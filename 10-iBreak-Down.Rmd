#  Break-down Plots for Models with Interactions (iBreak-down Plots) {#iBreakDown}

In Chapter \@ref(breakDown), we presented a model-agnostic approach to evaluation of the importance of an explanatory variable for model predictions. An important issue is that, for models with interactions, the estimated value of the variable-importance measure depends on the ordering of the explanatory varaibles that is used when computing the measure. 

In this chapter, we present an algorithm that addresses the issue. In particular, the algorithm identifies interactions between pairs of variables and takes them into account when constructing Break-down (BD) plots. In our presentation we focus on interactions that involve pairs of explanatory variables, but the algorithm can be easily extended to interactions involving a larger number of variables.

## Intuition {#iBDIntuition}

An interation means that the effect of an explanatory variable depends on the value(s) of other variable(s). To illustrate such a situation, we will consider the Titanic dataset (see Section \@ref(TitanicDataset). For the sake of simplicity, we consider only two variables, `age` and `class`. In the data `age` is a continuous variable, but we will use a dichotomized version of it, with two levels: boys (0-16 years old) and adults (17+ years old). Also, we will consider just two classess: the 2nd and "other".

Table \@ref(tab:titanicMaleSurvival) shows percentages of survivors for boys and adult men in the 2nd class and other classes on Titanic. Overall, the proportion of surviors among males is 20.5%. However, among boys in the 2nd class, the proportion is 91.7%. How do age and class contribute to this higher survival probability? Let us consider the following two decompositions.

* The overall probability of survival for males is 20.5%, but for the male passengers from the 2nd class the probability is even lower, i.e. 13.5%. Thus, the effect of the 2nd class is negative, as it decreases the probability of survival by 7%. Now, if, for male passengers of the 2nd class, we  consider age, we see that the survival probability for boys increases by 78.2%, from 13.5% (for a male in the 2nd class) to 91.7%. Thus, by considering first the effect of the class, and then the effect of age, we can conclude the effect of -7% for the 2nd class and +78.2% for age (being a boy).
* The overall probability of survival for males is 20.5%, but for boys the probability is higher, i.e., 40.7%. Thus, the effect of age (being a boy) is positive, as it increases the survival probability by 20.2%. On the other hand, for boys, travelling in the 2nd class increases the probability further, from 40.7% overall to 91.7%. Thus, by considering first the effect of age, and then the effect of class, we can conclude the effect of +20.2% for age (being a boy) and +51% for the 2nd class.

By considering effects of class and age in different order, we get very different contributions. This is because there is an interaction: the effect of class depends on the age and ``vice versa``. In particular, from Table \@ref(tab:titanicMaleSurvival) we could conclude that the overall effect of 2nd class is negative (-7%), as it decreases the probability of survival from 20.5% to 13.5%. On the other hand, the overall effect of age (being a boy) is positive (+20.2%), as it increases the probability of survival from 20.5% to 40.7%. Based on those effects, we would expect a probability of 20.5%-7%+20.2%=33.7% for a boy in the 2nd class. However, the actually observed proportion is much higher, 90.7%. The difference of 90.7%-33.7%=57% is the interaction effect. We can intepret it as an additional effect of the 2nd class specific for boys, or as an additional effect of age (being a boy) for the 2nd class male passengers.   

Table: (\#tab:titanicMaleSurvival) Proportions of survivors for men on Titanic.

|Class            |Boys (0-16)    |Adults (>16)     |Total            |
|:----------------|:--------------|:----------------|:----------------|
|2nd              |11/12 = 91.7%  |13/166 = 7.8%    |24/178 = 13.5%   |
|other            |22/69 = 31.9%  |306/1469 = 20.8% |328/1538 = 21.3% |
|Total            |33/81 = 40.7%  |319/1635 = 19.5% |352/1716 = 20.5% |


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(DALEX)

titanicM <- titanic[titanic$gender == "male",]
tab3 <- addmargins(table(titanicM$class, titanicM$age > 16, titanicM$survived))

table_formated <- apply(tab3, 1:2, function(x) {
  paste0(x[2], "/", sum(x), " = ", round(100*x[2]/sum(x), 1), "%")
})
knitr::kable(table_formated, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Caption.')
```

The example illustrates that interactions complicate the evaluation of the importance of explanatory variables to model predictions. In what follows we present a simple alogrithm to include interactions in the BD plots. 

## Method {#iBDMethod}

Identification of interactions in the model is performed in three steps [@iBreakDownRPackage]:

1. Calculate the variable-importance measure separately for each explanatory variable. In particular, for each variable, compute $\Delta^{j|\emptyset}(x_*)$ (see Section \@ref(BDMethod)).
2. Calculate the measure for each pair of variables. Subtract the obtained value from the sum of the measures for the particular variables to obtain a contribution attributable to an interaction. In particular, for each pair of variables, compute $\Delta^{\{i,j\}|\emptyset}$ (see Section \@ref(BDMethod)) and then $\Delta^{\{i,j\}}_I(x_*) \equiv \Delta^{\{i,j\}|\emptyset}(x_*)-\Delta^{i|\emptyset}(x_*)-\Delta^{j|\emptyset}(x_*)$.
3. Rank the so-obtained importance measures for the ``main'' and interaction effects to determine the final ordering for computing the variable-importance measures. Using the ordering, compute variable-importance measures $v(j, x_*) = \Delta^{j|\{1,  ..., j-1\}}(x_*)$ (see Section \@ref(BDMethod)).

The numerical complexity of the first step is $O(p)$, where $p$ is the number of explanatory variables. For the second step, the complexity is $O(p^2)$, while for the third step it is $O(p)$. Thus, the complexity of the entire procedure is $O(p^2)$.

## Example: Titanic data {#iBDExample} 

Let us consider the random-forest model `titanic_rf_v6` (see Section \@ref(model-titanic-rf) and passenger `johny_d` (see Section \@ref(predictions-titanic)) as the instance of interest in the Titanic data. [TOMASZ; JOHNY_D FROM BELFAST IN SECTION \@ref(predictions-titanic).]

Table \@ref(tab:titanicIBreakDownList) presents the expected model predictions $E_X[f(X)|X^i = x_*^i, X^j = x_*^j]$, single-variable effects $\Delta^{\{i,j\}|\emptyset}(x_*)$, and interaction effects $\Delta_{I}^{\{i,j\}}(x_*)$ for each explanatory variable and each pair of variables. All the measures are calculated for `johny_d`, the instance of interest. The rows of the table are sorted according to the absolute value of the last column (if provided) [TOMASZ: UNCLEAR.].

Based on the ordering of the rows, the following sequence of variables is identified as informative: `age`, `fare:class`, `gender`, `embarked`, `sibsp`, and `parch`. [TOMASZ: WHY?]

## Pros and cons {#iBDProsCons}

iBD plots share many features of BD plots for models without interactions. However, in case of interactions, the iBD plots provide more correct explanations. 

Though the numerical complexity of the iBD procedure is quadratic, it may be time-consuming in case of models with a large number of explanaotry variables. For such models, the results may be sensitive to noise, because the  number of pairs grows faster than the number of variables. [TOMASZ: "NOISE" IN WHICH SENSE?]. The identification of interactions in the presented procedure is not based on a formal statistical significance test. Thus, for small sample sizes, the procedure may be prone to errors.

## Code snippets for R {#iBDRcode}

For illustration purposes, we use the `titanic_rf_v6` random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section \@ref(model-titanic-rf). Recall that it is developed to predict the probability of survival from sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for a single observation: `johny_d` - an 8-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class.

`DALEX` explainers for the model and the `jonhy_d` data are retrieved via `archivist` hooks as listed in Section \@ref(ListOfModelsTitanic). 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library("randomForest")
explain_rf_v6 <- archivist::aread("pbiecek/models/9b971")

library("DALEX")
johny_d <- archivist::aread("pbiecek/models/e3596")
johny_d
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library("randomForest")
library("DALEX")
load("models/explain_rf_v6.rda")
load("models/johny_d.rda")
```

The key function to construct iBD plots is the `iBreakDown::break_down()` function from the `iBreakDown` R package [@iBreakDownRPackage]. The use of the function has already been explained in Section \@ref(BDR). The additional necessary argument is `interactions = TRUE`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("iBreakDown")
bd_rf <- break_down(explain_rf_v6, johny_d, interactions = TRUE)

bd_rf
```

Applying the generic `plot()` function to the object resulting from the application of the `break_down()` function creates an iBD plot. In this case, it is the plot from Figure \@ref(fig:iBreakDownTitanicExamplePlot).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(bd_rf) 
```
