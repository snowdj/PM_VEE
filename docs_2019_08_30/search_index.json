GitHub contributors included, agosiewska, Rees Morrison. 1.2 The aim of the book Predictive models are used to guess (statisticians would say: predict) values of a variable of interest based on other variables. As an example, consider prediction of sales based on historical data, prediction of risk of heart disease based on patient characteristics, or prediction of political attitudes based on Facebook comments. Predictive models have been constructed through the enitre human history. Ancient Egyptians, for instance, used observations of the rising of Sirius to predict flooding of the Nile. A more rigorous approach to model construction may be attributed to the method of least squares, published more than two centuries ago by Legendre in 1805 and by Gauss in 1809. With time, the number of applications in economy, medicine, biology, and agriculture has grown. The term regression was coined by Francis Galton in 1886. Initially, it was referring to biological applications, while today it is used for various models that allow prediction of continuous variables. Prediction of nominal variables is called classification, and its beginning may be attributed to works of Ronald Fisher in 1936. During the last century, many statistical models that can be used for predictive purposes have been developed. These include linear models, generalized linear models, regression and classification trees, rule-based models, and many others. Developments in mathematical foundations of predictive models were boosted by increasing computational power of personal computers and availability of large datasets in the era of ,,big data’’ that we have entered. With the increasing demand for predictive models, model features such as flexibility, ability to perform internally variable selection (feature engineering), and high precision of predictions are of interest. To obtain robust models, ensembles of models are used. Techniques like bagging, boosting, or model stacking combine hundreds or thousands of small models into a one super-model. Large deep neural models have over a billion parameters. There is a cost of this progress. Complex models may seem to operate like ,,black boxes’‘. It may be difficult, or even impossible, to understand how thousands of coefficients affect the model prediction. At the same time, complex models may not work as well as we would like them to. An overview of real problems with large black-box models may be found in an excellent book of Cathy O’Neil (O’Neil 2016) or in her TED Talk ,,The era of blind faith in big data must end’’. There is a growing number of examples of predictive models with performance that deteriorated over time or became biased in some sense. For instance, IBM’s Watson for Oncology was criticized by oncologists for delivering unsafe and inaccurate recommendations (Ross and Swetliz 2018). Amazon’s system for CV screening was found to be biased against women (Dastin 2018). The COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) algorithm for predicting recidivism, developed by Northpointe (now Equivant), is biased against blacks (Larson et al. 2016). These are examples of models and algorithms that led to serious violations of fairness and ethical principles. An example of situation when data drift led to deterioration in model performance is the Google Flu model, which gave worse predictions after two years than at baseline (Salzberg 2014), [Lazer et al Science 2014]. A reaction to some of these examples and problems are new regulations, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2018). Also, new civic rights are being formulated (Goodman and Flaxman 2016), (Casey, Farhangi, and Vogl 2018), (Ruiz 2018). A noteworthy example is the ,,Right to Explanation’’, i.e., the right to be provided an explanation for an output of an automated algorithm (Goodman and Flaxman 2016). To exercise the right, methods for verification, exploration, and explanation of predictive models are needed. We can conclude that, today, the true bottleneck in predictive modelling is not the lack of data, nor the lack of computational power, nor inadequate algorithms, nor the lack of flexible models. It is the lack of tools for model validation, model exploration, and explanation of model decisions. Thus, in this book, we present a collection of methods that may be used for this purpose. As development of such methods is a very active area of research and new methods become available almost on a continuous basis, we do not aim at being exhaustive. Rather, we present the mind-set, key problems, and several examples of methods that can be used in model exploration. Figure 1.1: (fig:DrWhyAIPMVEE) Visual exploration of predictive models help in every phase of model life-cycle. Model level methods help in early crisp modeling. Instance level methods help in debugging. Feature effects help to cross-compare candidate models. Auditors help to identify weak sides of considered models. 1.3 A bit of philosophy: three laws of model explanation Seventy-six years ago, Isaac Asimov forumlated Three Laws of Robotics: 1) a robot may not injure a human being, 2) a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings, and 3) a robot must protect its own existence. Today’s robots, like cleaning robots, robotic pets, or autonomous cars are far from being conscious enough to fall under Asimov’s ethics. However, we are more and more surrounded by complex predictive models and algorithms used for decision making. Machine-learning models are used in health care, politics, education, justice, and many other areas. The models and algorithms have a far larger influence on our lives than physical robots. Yet, applications of such models are left unregulated despite examples of their potential harmfulness. See Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O’Neil (O’Neil 2016) for an excellent overview of selected problems. It’s clear that we need to control the models and algorithms that may affect us. Thus, Asimov’s laws are referred to in the context of the discussion around Ethics of Artifical Intelligence. Initiatives to formulate principles for AI development have been undertaken, for instance, in the UK [Olhede &amp; Wolfe, Significance 2018, 15: 6-7]. Following Asimov’s approach, we propose three requirements that any predictive model should fulfill: Prediction’s justification. For every prediction of a model, one should be able to understand which variables affect the prediction and to what extent. Prediction’s speculation. For every prediction of a model, one should be able to understand how the model prediction would change if input variables changed. Prediction’s validation. For every prediction of a model, one should be able to verify how strong is the evidence that confirms the prediction. We see two ways to comply with these requirements. One is to use only models that fulfill these conditions by design. However, the price for transparency may be a reduction in performance. Another way is to use tools that allow, perhaps by using approximations, to ,,explain’’ predictions for any model. In our book, we will focus on the latter approach. 1.4 Terminology It is worth noting that, when it comes to predictive models, the same concepts have often been given different names in statistics and in machine learning. For instance, in the statistical-modelling literature, one refers to ,,explanatory variables,’’ with ,,independent variables,’’ ,,predictors,’’ or ,,covariates’’ as often-used equivalents. Explanatory variables are used in the model as means to explain (predict) the ,,dependent variable,’’ also called ,,predicted’’ variable or ,,response.’’ In machine-learning terminology, ,,input variables’’ or ,,features’’ are used to predict the ,,output’’ variable. In statistical modelling, models are fit to the data that contain ,,observations,’’ whereas in the machine-learning world a dataset may contain ,,instances.’’ To the extent possible, in our book we try to consistently use the statistical-modelling terminology. However, the reader may find references to a ,,feature’’ here and there. Somewhat inconsistently, we also introduce the term ,,instance-level’’ explanation. Instance-level explanation methods are designed to extract information about the behavior of the model related to a specific observation (or instance). On the other hand, ,,global’’ explanation techniques allow obtaining information about the behavior of the model for an entire dataset. We consider models for dependent variables that can be continuous or nominal. The values of a continuous variable can be represented by numbers with an ordering that makes some sense (zip codes or phone numbers are not considered as continuous variables). A continuous variable does not have to be continuous in the mathematical sense; counts (number of floors, steps, etc.) will be treated as continuous variables as well. A nominal variable can assume only a finite set of values that cannot be given numeric values. In this book we focus on ,,black-box’’ models. We discuss them in a bit more detail in the next section. 1.5 Glass-box models vs. black-box models Black-box models are models with a complex structure that is hard to understand by humans. Usually this refers to a large number of model coefficients. As people vary in their capacity to understand complex models, there is no strict threshold for the number of coefficients that makes a model a black-box. In practice, for most people this threshold is probably closer to 10 than to 100. A ,,glass-box’’ (sometimes called white-box) model, which is opposite to a ,,black-box’’ one, is a model that is easy to understand (though maybe not by every pearson). It has a simple structure and a limited number of coefficients. The two most common classess of glass-box models are decision or regression trees, as an example in Figure 1.2, or models with an additive structure, like the following model for mortality risk in melanoma patients: \\[ RelativeRisk = 1 + 3.6 * [Breslow &gt; 2] - 2 * [TILs &gt; 0] \\] In the model, two explanatory variables are used: an indicator whether the thickness of the lesion according to the Breslow scale is larger than 2 mm and an indicator whether the percentage of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is larger than 0. The structure of a glass box-model is, in general, easy to understand. It may be difficult to collect the necessary data, build the model, fit it to the data, or perform model validation, but once the model has been developed its interpretation and mode of working is straightforward. Why is it important to understand the model structure? There are several important advantages. If the model structure is clear, we can easily see which variables are included in the model and which are not. Hence, for instance, we may be able to, question the model when a particular explanatory variable was excluded from it. Also, in the case of a model with a clear structure and a limited number of coefficients, we can easily link changes in model predictions with changes in particular explanatory variables. This, in turn, may allow us to challenge the model against domain knowledge if, for instance, the effect of a particular variable on predictions is inconsistent with previously established results. Note that linking changes in model predictions with changes in particular explanatory variables may be difficult when there are many variables and/or coefficients in the model. For instance, a classification tree with hundreds of nodes is difficult to understand, as is a linear regression model with hundreds of cofficients. Comprehending the performance of a black-box models presents more challenges. The structure of a complex model, such as a neural-network model, mmay be far from transparent. Consequently, we may not understand which features influence the model decisions and bby how much. Consequently, it may be difficult to decide whether the model is consistent with our domain knowledge. In our book we present tools that can help in extracting the information necessary for the evaluation of complex models. Figure 1.2: (fig:BILLCD8) Example tree model for melanoma risk 1.6 Model visualization, exploration, and explanation In general, the lifecycle of a model can be divided, into three phases: development (or building), deployment, and maintenance. Model development is the phase in which one is looking for the best available model. During this process, model exploration tools are useful. Exploration involves evaluation of the fit of the model, verification of the assumptions underlying the model (diagnostics), and assessment of the predictive performance of the model (validation). In our book we will focus on the visualization tools that can be useful in model exploration. We will not, however, discuss visualization methods for diagnostic purposes, as they are extensively discussed in many books devoted to statistical modelling. Model deployment is the phase in which a predictive model is adopted for use. In this phase, it is crucial that the users gain confidence in using the model. It is worth noting that the users might not have been involved in the model development. Moreover, they may only have access to the binary implementation of the model, may not provide any insight into the details of the model structure. In this situation, model explanation tools can help to understand the factors that influence model predictions and boost confidence in the model. The tools are one of the main focus points of our book. Finally, a deployed model requires maintenance. In this phase, one monitors a model performance by, for instance, checking the validity of predictions for different datasets. If issues are detected, model explanation tools may be used to find the source of the problem and to suggest a modification of the structure of the model. 1.7 Model-agnostic vs. model-specific approach Some classes of models have been developed for a long period of time or have attracted intensive research. Consequently, those classes of models are equipped with excellent tools for model exploration or visualisation. For example: There are many tools for diagnostics and evaluation of linear models. Model assumptions are formally defined (normality, linear structure, homogenous variance) and can be checked by using normality tests or plots (normal qq-plot), diagnostic plots, tests for model structure, tools for identification of outliers, etc. For many more advanced models with an additive structure, like the proportional hazards model, many tools can be used for checking model assumptions. Random-forest models are equipped with the out-of-bag method of evaluating performance and several tools for measuring variable importance (Breiman et al. 2018). Methods have been developed to extract information from the model structure about possible interactions (Paluszynska and Biecek 2017b). Similar tools have been developed for other ensembles of trees, like xgboost models (Foster 2018). Neural networks enjoy a large collection of dedicated model-explanation tools that use, for instance, the layer-wise relevance propagation technique (Bach et al. 2015), or saliency maps technique (Simonyan, Vedaldi, and Zisserman 2013), or a mixed approach. Of course, the list of model classes with dedicated collections of model-explanation and/or diagnostics methods is much longer. This variety of model-specific approaches does lead to issues, though. For instance, one cannot easily compare explanations for two models with different structures. Also, every time a new architecture or a new ensemble of models is proposed, one needs to look for new methods of model exploration. Finally, for brand-new models no tools for model explanation or diagnostics may be immediately available. For these reasons, in our book we focus on model-agnostic techniques. In particular, we prefer not to assume anything about the model structure, as we may be dealing with a black-box model with an unclear structure. In that case, the only operation that we may be able to perform is evaluation of a model for a selected observation. However, while we do not assume anything about the structure of the model, we will assume that the model operates on \\(p\\)-dimensional vectors and, for a single vector, it returns a single value which is a real number. This assumption holds for a broad range of models for data such as tabular data, images, text data, videos, etc. It may not be suitable for, e.g., models with memory like seq2seq models (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014) or Long Short Term Memory models (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) in which the model output depends also on sequence of previous inputs. 1.8 Notation Methods described in this book were developed by different authors, who used different mathematical notations. We try to keep the mathematical notation consistent throughout the entre book. In some cases this may result in formulae wth a fairly complex system of indices. In this section, we provide a general overview of the notation we use. Whenever necessary, parts of the notation will be explained again in subsequent chapters. We consider predictive models that operate on a \\(p\\)-dimensional input space \\(\\mathcal X\\). By \\(x \\in \\mathcal X\\) we will refer to a single point in this input space. In some cases models are described in context of a dataset with \\(n\\) observations. By \\(x_i\\) we refer to the \\(i\\)-th observation in this dataset. Of course, \\(x_i \\in \\mathcal X\\). Some explainers are constructed around an observation of interest which will be denoted by \\(x_{*}\\). The observation may not necessarily belong to the analyzed dataset; hence, the use of the asterisk in the index. Of course, \\(x_* \\in \\mathcal X\\). Points in \\(\\mathcal X\\) are \\(p\\) dimensional vectors. We will refer to the \\(j\\)-th coordinate by using \\(j\\) in superscript. Thus, \\(x^j_i\\) deontes the \\(j\\)-th coordinate of the \\(i\\)-th observation from the analyzed dataset. If \\(\\mathcal J\\) denotes a subset of indices, then \\(x^{\\mathcal J}\\) denotes the elements of vector \\(x\\) corresponding to the indices included in \\(\\mathcal J\\). We will use the notation \\(x^{-j}\\) to refer to a vector that results from removing the \\(j\\)-th coordinate from vector \\(x\\). By \\(x^{j|=z}\\), we denote a vector with the values at all coordinates equal to the values in \\(x\\), except of the \\(j\\)-th coordinate, which is set equal to \\(z\\). So, if \\(w=x^{j|=z}\\), then \\(w^j = z\\) and \\(\\forall_{k\\neq j} w^k = x^k\\). In this book, a model is a function \\(f:\\mathcal X \\rightarrow y\\) that transforms a point from \\(\\mathcal X\\) into a real number. In most cases, the presented methods can be used directly for multi-variate dependent variables; however, we use examples with uni-variate responses to simplify the notation. We will use \\(r_i = y_i - f(x_i)\\) we refer to the model residual, i.e., the difference between the observed value of the dependent variable \\(Y\\) for the \\(i\\)-th observation from a particular dataset and the model prediction for the observaton. 1.9 The structure of the book Our book is split in two parts. In the part Instance-level explainers, we present techniques for exploration and explanation of model predictions for a single observation. On the other hand, in the part Global explainers, we present techniques for exploration and explanation of model’s performance for an entire dataset. Before embarking on the description of the methods, in Chapter 2, we provide a short description of R tools and packages that are necessary to replicate the results presented for various methods. In Chapter 4, we describe three datasets that are used throughout the book to illustrate the presented methods and tools. The Instance-level explainers part of the book consists of Chapters 6-??. In Chapters 6-8, methods based on Ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles are presented. The profiles show the change of model-based predictions induced by a change of a single variable; they are introduced in Chapter 6. Chapter 7 presents a CP-profile-based measure that summarizes the impact of a selected variable on model’s predictions. The measure can be used to select the profiles that are worth plotting for a model with a large number of explanatory variables. Chapter 8 describes local-fidelity plots that are useful to investigate the sources of a poor prediction for a particular single observation. Chapters 9-11 present methods to decompose variable contributions to model predictions. In particular, Chapter 9 introduces Break-down (BD) plots for models with additive effects. On the other hand, Chapter 10 presents a method for models including interactions. Finally, Chapter 11 describes an alternative method for decomposing model predictions that is closely linked with Shapley values (Shapley 1953) developed originally for cooperative games. Chapter 12 presens a different approach to explanation of single-instance predictions. It is based on a local approximation of a black-box model by a simpler, glass-box one. In paricular, in the chapter, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016) is discussed. The final chapter of the first part, Chapter ??, presence a comparison of various instance-level explainers. The Global explainers part of the book consists of Chapters ??-23. In each part, every method is described in a separate chapter that has the same structure: * Subsection Introduction explains the goal of and the general idea behind the method. * Subsection Method shows mathematical or computational details related to the method. This subsection can be skipped if you are not interested in the details. * Subsection Example shows an exemplary application of the method with discussion of results. * Subsection Pros and cons summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the method. It also provides some guideance regarding when to use the method. * Subsection Code snippets shows the implementation of the method in R and Python. This subsection can be skipped if you are not interested in the implementation. Finally, we would like to signal that, in this book, we do show how to determine features that affect model prediction for a single observation. In particular, we present the theory and examples of methods that can be used to explain prediction like break down plots, ceteris paribus profiles, local-model approximations, or Shapley values. techniques to examine fully-trained machine-learning models as a whole. In particular, we review the theory and examples of methods that can be used to explain model performance globally, like partial-dependency plots, variable-importance plots, and others. charts that can be used to present key information in a quick way. tools and methods for model comparison. code snippets for R and Python that explain how to use the described methods. On the other hand, in this book, we do not focus on any specific model. The techniques presented are model agnostic and do not make any assumptions related to model structure. data exploration. There are very good books on this topic, like R for Data Science http://r4ds.had.co.nz/ or TODO the process of model building. There are also very good books on this topic, see An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ or TODO any particular tools for model building. These are discussed, for instance, in Applied Predictive Modeling by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/ 1.10 Acknowledgements Przemek’s work on interpretability started during research trips within the RENOIR project (691152 - H2020/2016-2019).

["doItYourselfWithR.html", "Chapter 2 Do-it-yourself With R 2.1 What to install? 2.2 How to work with DALEX? 2.3 How to work with archivist? 2.4 DrWhy Packages", " Chapter 2 Do-it-yourself With R In our book we introduce different methods for instance-level and global explanation and exploration of predictive models. In each chapter, there is a section with code snippets for R that show how a particular method has been implemented. In this chapter we provide a short description of steps that will allow the reader to replicate the results presented for various methods. 2.1 What to install? Obviously, R (R Core Team 2018) is needed. It is always better to use the newest version, but at least R in version 3.5 should be used. R can be downloaded from https://cran.r-project.org/. A good editor makes working with R much easier. There is a plenty of choices, but, especially for beginners, it is worth considering the RStudio editor, an open-source and enterprise-ready tool for R. It can be downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/. Once R and the editor are available, the required packages should be installed. The most important one is the DALEX package. It is the entry point to solutions introduced in this book. The package can be installed by executing the following command from the R command line: install.packages(&quot;DALEX&quot;) Installation of DALEX will automatically take care about installation of other hard requirements (packages required by it), like the ggplot2 package for data visualization. To repeat all examples in this book, two additional packages are needed: ingredients and iBreakDown. The easiest way to get them, including other useful weak dependencies, is to execute the following command: DALEX::install_dependencies() 2.2 How to work with DALEX? To conduct model exploration with DALEX, first, a model has to be created. Then the model has got to be prepared for exploration. There are many packages in R that can be used to construct a model. Some packages are structure-specific, like randomForest for Random-Forest Classification and Regression models (Liaw and Wiener 2002a), gbm for Generalized Boosted Regression Models (Ridgeway 2017), extensions for Generalized Linear Models (Harrell Jr 2018), or many others. There is also a number of packages that can be used for constucting models with different structures. These include the h2o package (LeDell et al. 2019), caret (Jed Wing et al. 2016) and its successor parsnip (Kuhn and Vaughan 2019), a very powerful and extensible mlr (Bischl et al. 2016), or keras that is a wrapper to Python library with the same name (Allaire and Chollet 2019). While it is great to have such a large choice of tools for constructing models, the downside is that different packages have different interfaces and different arguments. Moreover, model-objects created with different packages may have different internal structures. The main goal of the DALEX package (Biecek 2018) is to create a level of abstraction around a model that makes it easier to explore and explain the model. Function DALEX::explain is THE function for model wrapping. The function requires five arguments: model, a model-object; data, a data frame with validation data; y, observed values of the dependent variable for the validation data; it is an optional argument, required for explainers focused on model validation and benchmarking. predict_function, a function that returns prediction scores; if not specified, then a default predict() function is used. Note that, for some models, the default predict() function returns classes; in such cases you should provide a function that will return numerical scores. label, a name of a model; if not specified, then it is extracted from the class(model). This name will be presented in figures, so it is recommended to make the name informative. For an example, see Section 4.1.6. 2.3 How to work with archivist? As we will focus on exploration of predictive models, we prefer not to waste space nor time on replication of the code necessary for model development. This is where the archivist packages helps. The archivist package (Biecek and Kosinski 2017) is designed to store, share, and manage R objects. We will use it to easily access R models and explainers. To install the package, the following command should be executed in the R command line: install.packages(&quot;archivist&quot;) Once the package has been installed, function aread() can be used to retrieve R objects from any remote repository. For this book, we use a GitHub repository models hosted at https://github.com/pbiecek/models. For instance, to download a model with the md5 hash ceb40, the following command has to be executed: archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/ceb40&quot;) Since the md5 hash ceb40 uniquely defines the model, referring to the repository object results in using exactly the same model and the same explanations. Thus, in the subsequent chapters, pre-constructed model explainers will be accessed with archivist hooks. 2.4 DrWhy Packages Here we present list of arguments in explainers from DrWhy universe. All explainers use unified set of arguments. All of them are generic with two specific implementations *.explainer and *.default. The first one is working for objects created with DALEX::explain() function. Common core arguments x a model to be explained, or an explainer created with function DALEX::explain(). data validation dataset. Used to determine univariate distributions, calculation of quantiles, correlations and so on. It will be extracted from x if it’s an explainer. predict_function predict function that operates on the model x. Since the model is a black box, the predict_function is the only interface to access values from the model. It should be a function that takes at least a model x and data and returns vector of predictions. If model response has more than a single number (like multiclass models) then this function should return a marix/data.frame of the size m x d, where m is the number of observations while d is the dimensionality of model response. It will be extracted from x if it’s an explainer. new_observation an observation/observations to be explained. Required for local/instance level explainers. Columns in should correspond to columns in the data argument. ... other parameters. label name of the model. By default it’s extracted from the class attribute of the model Function specific arguments keep_distributions if TRUE, then distributions of partial predictions is stored and can be plotted with the generic plot().

The second one will provide an example for models for a continuous variable. Finally, the third dataset will be used for illustration of models for a categorical dependent variable. In this chapter, we provide a short description of each of the datasets, together with results of exploratory analyses. We also introduce models that will be used for illustration purposes in subsequent chapters. 4.1 Sinking of the RMS Titanic Titanic sinking by Willy Stöwer Sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history (during peacetime). Over 1500 people died as a consequence of collision with an iceberg. Projects like Encyclopedia titanica https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/ are a source of rich and precise data about Titanic’s passengers. The data are available in a dataset included in the stablelearner package. The dataset, after some data cleaning and variable transformations, is also avaliable in the DALEX package. In particular, the `titanic’ data frame contains 2207 observations (for 1317 passengers and 890 crew members) and nine variables: gender, person’s (passenger’s or crew member’s) gender, a factor (categorical variable) with two levels (categories); age, person’s age in years, a numerical variable; for adults, the age is given in (integer) years; for children younger than one year, the age is given as \\(x/12\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of months of child’s age; class, the class in which the passenger travelled, or the duty class of a crew member; a factor with seven levels embarked, the harbor in which the person embarked on the ship, a factor with four levels; country, person’s home country, a factor with 48 levels; fare, the price of the ticket (only available for passengers; 0 for crew members), a numerical variable; sibsp, the number of siblings/spouses aboard the ship, a numerical variable; parch, the number of parents/children aboard the ship, a numerical variable; survived, a factor with two levels indicating whether the person survived or not. The R code below provides more info about the contents of the dataset, values of the variables, etc. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) head(titanic, 2) ## gender age class embarked country fare sibsp parch survived ## 1 male 42 3rd Southampton United States 7.11 0 0 no ## 2 male 13 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 0 2 no str(titanic) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 2207 obs. of 9 variables: ## $ gender : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;: 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ age : num 42 13 16 39 16 25 30 28 27 20 ... ## $ class : Factor w/ 7 levels &quot;1st&quot;,&quot;2nd&quot;,&quot;3rd&quot;,..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 3 3 ... ## $ embarked: Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;Belfast&quot;,&quot;Cherbourg&quot;,..: 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 4 ... ## $ country : Factor w/ 48 levels &quot;Argentina&quot;,&quot;Australia&quot;,..: 44 44 44 15 30 44 17 17 26 16 ... ## $ fare : num 7.11 20.05 20.05 20.05 7.13 ... ## $ sibsp : num 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 ... ## $ parch : num 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ survived: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;no&quot;,&quot;yes&quot;: 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 ... levels(titanic$class) ## [1] &quot;1st&quot; &quot;2nd&quot; &quot;3rd&quot; ## [4] &quot;deck crew&quot; &quot;engineering crew&quot; &quot;restaurant staff&quot; ## [7] &quot;victualling crew&quot; levels(titanic$embarked) ## [1] &quot;Belfast&quot; &quot;Cherbourg&quot; &quot;Queenstown&quot; &quot;Southampton&quot; Models considered for this dataset will use survived as the (binary) dependent variable. 4.1.1 Data exploration It is always advisable to explore data before modelling. However, as this book is focused on model exploration, we will limit the data exploration part. Before exploring the data, we first do some pre-processing. In particular, the value of variables age, country, sibsp, parch, and fare is missing for a limited number of observations (2, 81, 10, 10, and 26, respectively). Analyzing data with missing values is a topic on its own (Little and Rubin 1987; Schafer 1997; Molenberghs and Kenward 2007). An often-used approach is to impute the missing values. Toward this end, multiple imputation should be considered (Schafer 1997; Molenberghs and Kenward 2007; van Buuren 2012). However, given the limited number of missing values and the intended illustrative use of the dataset, we will limit ourselves to, admittedly inferior, single imputation. In particular, we replace the missing age values by the mean of the observed ones, i.e., 30. Missing country will be coded by “X”. For sibsp and parch, we replace the missing values by the most frequently observed value, i.e., 0. Finally, for fare, we use the mean fare for a given class, i.e., 0 pounds for crew, 89 pounds for the 1st, 22 pounds for the 2nd, and 13 pounds for the 3rd class. The R code presented below implements the imputation steps. # missing age is replaced by average (30) titanic$age[is.na(titanic$age)] = 30 # missing country is replaced by &quot;X&quot; titanic$country &lt;- as.character(titanic$country) titanic$country[is.na(titanic$country)] = &quot;X&quot; titanic$country &lt;- factor(titanic$country) # missing fare is replaced by class average titanic$fare[is.na(titanic$fare) &amp; titanic$class == &quot;1st&quot;] = 89 titanic$fare[is.na(titanic$fare) &amp; titanic$class == &quot;2nd&quot;] = 22 titanic$fare[is.na(titanic$fare) &amp; titanic$class == &quot;3rd&quot;] = 13 # missing sibsp, parch are replaced by 0 titanic$sibsp[is.na(titanic$sibsp)] = 0 titanic$parch[is.na(titanic$parch)] = 0 After imputing the missing values, we investigate the association between survival status and other variables. Figures 4.1-4.6 present graphically the proportion non- and survivors for different levels of the other variables. The height of the bars (on the y-axis) reflects the marginal distribution (proportions) of the observed levels of the variable. On the other hand, the width of the bars (on the x-axis) provides the information about the proportion of non- and survivors. Note that, to construct the graphs for age and fare, we categorized the range of the observed values. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 indicate that the proportion of survivors was larger for females and children below 5 years of age. This is most likely the result of the “women and children first” principle that is often evoked in situations that require evacuation of persons whose life is in danger. The principle can, perhaps, partially explain the trend seen in Figures 4.3 and 4.4, i.e., a higher proportion of survivors among those with 1-3 parents/children and 1-2 siblings/spouses aboard. Figure 4.5 indicates that passengers travelling in the first and second class had a higher chance of survival, perhaps due to the proximity of the location of their cabins to the deck. Interestingly, the proportion of survivors among crew deck was similar to the proportion of the first-class passengers. Figure 4.6 shows that the proportion of survivors increased with the fare, which is consistent with the fact that the proportion was higher for passengers travelling in the first and second class. Finally, Figures 4.7 and 4.8 do not suggest any noteworthy trends. Figure 4.1: Survival according to gender in the Titanic data. Figure 4.2: Survival accroding to age group in the Titanic data. Figure 4.3: Survival according to the number of parents/children in the Titanic data. Figure 4.4: Survival according to the number of siblings/spouses in the Titanic data. Figure 4.5: Survival according to the class in the Titanic data. Figure 4.6: Survival according to fare in the Titanic data. Figure 4.7: Survival according to the port of embarking in the Titanic data. Figure 4.8: Survival according to country in the Titanic data. 4.1.2 Logistic regression The dependent variable of interest, survival, is binary. Thus, a natural choice to build a predictive model is logistic regression. We do not consider country as an explanatory variable. As there is no reason to expect a linear relationship between age and odds of survival, we use linear tail-restricted cubic splines, available in the rcs() function of the rms package (Harrell Jr 2018), to model the effect of age. We also do not expect linear relation for the fare variable, but because of it’s skewness, we do not use splines for this variable. The results of the model are stored in model-object titanic_lmr_v6, which will be used in subsequent chapters. library(&quot;rms&quot;) set.seed(1313) titanic_lmr_v6 &lt;- lrm(survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ gender + rcs(age) + class + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, titanic) titanic_lmr_v6 ## Logistic Regression Model ## ## lrm(formula = survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ gender + rcs(age) + class + ## sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) ## ## Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. ## Ratio Test Indexes Indexes ## Obs 2207 LR chi2 752.06 R2 0.404 C 0.817 ## FALSE 1496 d.f. 17 g 1.647 Dxy 0.635 ## TRUE 711 Pr(&gt; chi2) &lt;0.0001 gr 5.191 gamma 0.636 ## max |deriv| 0.0001 gp 0.282 tau-a 0.277 ## Brier 0.146 ## ## Coef S.E.

Random forest is known for good predictive performance, is able to grasp low-level variable interactions, and is quite stable (Breiman 2001). To fit the model, we apply the randomForest() function, with default settings, from the package with the same name (Liaw and Wiener 2002b). In the first instance, we fit a model with the same set of explanatory variables as the logistic regression model. The results of the model are stored in model-object titanic_rf_v6. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) set.seed(1313) titanic_rf_v6 &lt;- randomForest(survived ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) titanic_rf_v6 ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = survived ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic) ## Type of random forest: classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 2 ## ## OOB estimate of error rate: 18.62% ## Confusion matrix: ## no yes class.error ## no 1393 103 0.06885027 ## yes 308 403 0.43319269 For comparison purposes, we also consider a model with only three explanatory variables: class, gender, and age. The results of the model are stored in model-object titanic_rf_v3. titanic_rf_v3 &lt;- randomForest(survived ~ class + gender + age, data = titanic) titanic_rf_v3 ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = survived ~ class + gender + age, data = titanic) ## Type of random forest: classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 1 ## ## OOB estimate of error rate: 21.02% ## Confusion matrix: ## no yes class.error ## no 1367 129 0.08622995 ## yes 335 376 0.47116737 4.1.4 Gradient boosting Finally, we consider the gradient-boosting model. (Friedman 2000) The model is known for being able to accomodate higher-order interactions between variables. We use the same set of explanatory variables as for the logistic regression model. To fit the gradient-boosting model, we use function gbm() from the gbm package (Ridgeway 2017). The results of the model are stored in model-object titanic_gbm_v6. library(&quot;gbm&quot;) set.seed(1313) titanic_gbm_v6 &lt;- gbm(survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic, n.trees = 15000) ## Distribution not specified, assuming bernoulli ... titanic_gbm_v6 ## gbm(formula = survived == &quot;yes&quot; ~ class + gender + age + sibsp + ## parch + fare + embarked, data = titanic, n.trees = 15000) ## A gradient boosted model with bernoulli loss function. ## 15000 iterations were performed. ## There were 7 predictors of which 7 had non-zero influence. 4.1.5 Model predictions Let us now compare predictions that are obtained from the three different models. In particular, we will compute the predicted probability of survival for an 8-year-old boy who embarked in Belfast and travelled in the 1-st class with no parents nor siblings and with a ticket costing 72 pounds. First, we create a data frame johny_d that contains the data describing the passenger. johny_d &lt;- data.frame( class = factor(&quot;1st&quot;, levels = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;deck crew&quot;, &quot;engineering crew&quot;, &quot;restaurant staff&quot;, &quot;victualling crew&quot;)), gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;)), age = 8, sibsp = 0, parch = 0, fare = 72, embarked = factor(&quot;Belfast&quot;, levels = c(&quot;Belfast&quot;,&quot;Cherbourg&quot;,&quot;Queenstown&quot;,&quot;Southampton&quot;)) ) Subsequently, we use the generic function predict() to get the predicted probability of survival for the logistic regression model. (pred_lmr &lt;- predict(titanic_lmr_v6, johny_d, type = &quot;fitted&quot;)) ## 1 ## 0.7233413 The predicted probability is equal to 0.72. We do the same for the random forest and gradient boosting models. (pred_rf &lt;- predict(titanic_rf_v6, johny_d, type = &quot;prob&quot;)) ## no yes ## 1 0.626 0.374 ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;votes&quot; (pred_gbm &lt;- predict(titanic_gbm_v6, johny_d, type = &quot;response&quot;, n.trees = 15000)) ## [1] 0.6177055 As a result, we obtain the predicted probabilities of 0.37 and 0.62, respectively. The models lead to different probabilities. Thus, it might be of interest to understand the reason for the differences, as it could help us to decide which of the predictions we might want to trust. Note that for some examples we will use another observation (instance) with lower chances of survival. Let’s call this passenger Henry. henry &lt;- data.frame( class = factor(&quot;1st&quot;, levels = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;deck crew&quot;, &quot;engineering crew&quot;, &quot;restaurant staff&quot;, &quot;victualling crew&quot;)), gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;female&quot;, &quot;male&quot;)), age = 47, sibsp = 0, parch = 0, fare = 25, embarked = factor(&quot;Cherbourg&quot;, levels = c(&quot;Belfast&quot;,&quot;Cherbourg&quot;,&quot;Queenstown&quot;,&quot;Southampton&quot;)) ) round(predict(titanic_lmr_v6, henry, type = &quot;fitted&quot;),2) ## 1 ## 0.43 round(predict(titanic_rf_v6, henry, type = &quot;prob&quot;)[1,2],2) ## [1] 0.25 round(predict(titanic_gbm_v6, henry, type = &quot;response&quot;, n.trees = 15000),2) ## [1] 0.31 4.1.6 Explainers Model-objects created with different libraries may have different internal structures. Thus, first, we have got to create a wrapper around the model. Toward this end, we use the explain() function from the DALEX package (Biecek 2018). The function requires five arguments: model, a model-object; data, a validation data frame; y, observed values of the dependent variable for the validation data; predict_function, a function that returns prediction scores; if not specified, then a default predict() function is used; label, a function that returns prediction scores; if not specified, then it is extracted from the class(model). In the example below we create explainers for the logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models created for the Titanic data. Each explainer wraps all elements needed to create a model explanation, i.e., a suitable predict() function, validation data set, and the model object. Thus, in subsequent chapters we will use the explainers instead of the model objects to keep code snippets more concise. explain_titanic_lmr_v6 &lt;- explain(model = titanic_lmr_v6, data = titanic[, -9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, predict_function = function(m, x) predict(m, x, type = &quot;fitted&quot;), label = &quot;Logistic Regression v6&quot;) explain_titanic_rf_v6 &lt;- explain(model = titanic_rf_v6, data = titanic[, -9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest v6&quot;) explain_titanic_rf_v3 &lt;- explain(model = titanic_rf_v3, data = titanic[, -9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Random Forest v3&quot;) explain_titanic_gbm_v6 &lt;- explain(model = titanic_gbm_v6, data = titanic[, -9], y = titanic$survived == &quot;yes&quot;, label = &quot;Generalized Boosted Regression v6&quot;) 4.1.7 List of objects for the titanic example In the previous sections we have built several predictive models for the titanic data set. The models will be used in the rest of the book to illustrate the model explanation methods and tools. For the ease of reference, we summarize the models in Table 4.1. The binary model-objects can be downloaded by using the indicated archivist hooks (Biecek and Kosinski 2017). By calling a function specified in the last column of the table, one can recreate a selected model in a local R environment. Table 4.1: Predictive models created for the titanic dataset.

Various datasets for house prices are available at websites like Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com) or UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu). In this book, we will work with an interesting variant of this problem. The apartments dataset is an artificial dataset created to match key characteristics of real apartments in Warszawa, the capital of Poland. However, the dataset is created in a way that two very different models, namely linear regression and random forest, have almost exactly the same accuracy. The natural question is then: which model should we choose? We will show that the model-explanation tools provide important insight into the key model characteristics and are helpful in model selection. The dataset is available in the DALEX package (Biecek 2018). It contains 1000 observations (apartments) and six variables: m2.price, apatments price per meter-squared (in EUR), a numerical variable; construction.year, the year of construction of the block of flats in which the apartment is located, a numerical variable; surface, apartment’s total surface in squared meters, a numerical variable; floor, the floor at which the apartment is located (ground floor taken to be the first floor), a numerical integer variable with values from 1 to 10; no.rooms, the total number of rooms, a numerical variable with values from 1 to 6; distric, a factor with 10 levels indicating tha distric of Warszawa where the apartment is located. The R code below provides more info about the contents of the dataset, values of the variables, etc. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) head(apartments, 2) ## m2.price construction.year surface floor no.rooms district ## 1 5897 1953 25 3 1 Srodmiescie ## 2 1818 1992 143 9 5 Bielany str(apartments) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1000 obs. of 6 variables: ## $ m2.price : num 5897 1818 3643 3517 3013 ... ## $ construction.year: num 1953 1992 1937 1995 1992 ... ## $ surface : num 25 143 56 93 144 61 127 105 145 112 ... ## $ floor : int 3 9 1 7 6 6 8 8 6 9 ... ## $ no.rooms : num 1 5 2 3 5 2 5 4 6 4 ... ## $ district : Factor w/ 10 levels &quot;Bemowo&quot;,&quot;Bielany&quot;,..: 6 2 5 4 3 6 3 7 6 6 ... table(apartments$floor) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 90 116 87 86 95 104 103 103 108 108 table(apartments$no.rooms) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 99 202 231 223 198 47 levels(apartments$district) ## [1] &quot;Bemowo&quot; &quot;Bielany&quot; &quot;Mokotow&quot; &quot;Ochota&quot; &quot;Praga&quot; ## [6] &quot;Srodmiescie&quot; &quot;Ursus&quot; &quot;Ursynow&quot; &quot;Wola&quot; &quot;Zoliborz&quot; Models considered for this dataset will use m2.price as the (continuous) dependent variable. Model predictions will be obtained for a set of six apartments included in data frame apartments_test, also included in the DALEX package. head(apartments_test) ## m2.price construction.year surface floor no.rooms district ## 1001 4644 1976 131 3 5 Srodmiescie ## 1002 3082 1978 112 9 4 Mokotow ## 1003 2498 1958 100 7 4 Bielany ## 1004 2735 1951 112 3 5 Wola ## 1005 2781 1978 102 4 4 Bemowo ## 1006 2936 2001 116 7 4 Bemowo 4.2.1 Data exploration Note that apartments is an artificial dataset created to illustrate and explain differences between random forest and linear regression. Hence, the structure of the data, the form and strength of association between variables, plausibility of distributional assumptions, etc., is better than in a real-life dataset. In fact, all these characteristics of the data are known. Nevertheless, we conduct some data exploration to illustrate the important aspects of the data. The variable of interest is m2.price, the price per meter-squared. The histogram presented in Figure 4.9 indicates that the distribution of the variable is slightly skewed to the right. Figure 4.9: (fig:appartmentsExplorationMi2) Distribution of the price per meter-squared in the apartments data. Figure 4.10 suggests (possibly) a nonlinear relation between construction.year and m2.price. Figure 4.10: (fig:appartmentsMi2Construction) Price per meter-squared vs. construction year Figure 4.11 indicates a linear relation between surface and m2.price. Figure 4.11: (fig:appartmentsMi2Surface) Price per meter-squared vs. surface Relation between floor and m2.price is also close to linear, as seen in Figure 4.12. Figure 4.12: (fig:appartmentsMi2Floor) Price per meter-squared vs. floor There is a close to linear relation between no.rooms and m2.price, as suggested by Figure 4.13. It is worth noting that, quite naturally, surface and number of rooms are correlated (see Figure 4.14). Figure 4.13: (fig:appartmentsMi2Norooms) Price per meter-squared vs. number of rooms Figure 4.14: (fig:appartmentsSurfaceNorooms) Surface vs. number of rooms Prices depend on district. Violin plots in Figure 4.15 indicate that the highest prices per meter-squared are observed in Srodmiescie (Downtown). Figure 4.15: (fig:appartmentsMi2District) Price per meter-squared for different districts 4.2.2 Linear regression The dependent variable of interest, m2.price, is continuous. Thus, a natural choice to build a predictive model is linear regression. We treat all the other variables in the apartments data frame as explanatory and include them in the model. The results of the model are stored in model-object apartments_lm_v5. apartments_lm_v5 &lt;- lm(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) apartments_lm_v5 ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) construction.year surface ## 5003.248 -0.229 -10.238 ## floor no.rooms districtBielany ## -99.482 -37.730 34.106 ## districtPraga districtUrsynow districtBemowo ## -20.214 -1.974 16.891 ## districtUrsus districtZoliborz districtMokotow ## 46.833 906.865 935.271 ## districtOchota districtSrodmiescie ## 943.145 2097.502 4.2.3 Random forest As an alternative to linear regression, we consider a random forest model.

Subsequently, we compute the mean squared difference between the predicted and actual prices for the test apartments. We repeat the same steps for the random forest model. predicted_apartments_lm &lt;- predict(apartments_lm_v5, apartments_test) rmsd_lm &lt;- sqrt(mean((predicted_apartments_lm - apartments_test$m2.price)^2)) rmsd_lm ## [1] 283.0865 predicted_apartments_rf &lt;- predict(apartments_rf_v5, apartments_test) rmsd_rf &lt;- sqrt(mean((predicted_apartments_rf - apartments_test$m2.price)^2)) rmsd_rf ## [1] 282.9519 For the random forest model, the square-root of the mean squared difference is equal to 283. It is only minimally smaller than the value of 283.1, obtained for the linear regression model. Thus, the question we may face is: should we choose the more complex, but flexible random-forest model, or the simpler and easier to interpret linear model? In the subsequent chapters we will try to provide an answer to this question. 4.2.5 List of objects for the apartments example In Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 we have built two predictive models for the apartments data set. The models will be used in the rest of the book to illustrate the model explanation methods and tools. For the ease of reference, we summarize the models in Table 4.3. The binary model-objects can be downloaded by using the indicated archivist hooks (Biecek and Kosinski 2017). By calling a function specified in the last column of the table, one can recreate a selected model in a local R environment. Table 4.3: Predictive models created for the apartments dataset.

Get the explainer: TODO: add if needed 4.3 Hire or fire Predictive models can be used to support decisions. For instance, they can be used in a human-resources department to decide whether, for instance, to promote an employee. An advantage of using a model for this purpose would be the objectivity of the decision, which would not be subject to personal preferences of a manager. However, in such a situation, one would most likely want to understand what influences the model’s prediction. To illustrate such a situation, we will use the HR dataset that is available in the DALEX package (Biecek 2018). It is an artificial set of data from a human-resources department of a call center. It contains 7847 observations (employees of the call center) and six variables: gender, person’s gender, a factor with two levels; age, person’s age in years, a numerical variable; hours, average number of working hours per week, a numerical variable; evaluation, the last evaluation score, a numerical variable with values 2 (fail), 3 (satisfactory), 4 (good), and 5 (very good); salary, the salary level, a numerical variable with values from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest); status, a factor with three indicating whether the employee was fired, retained, or promoted. The R code below provides more info about the contents of the dataset, values of the variables, etc. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) head(HR, 4) ## gender age hours evaluation salary status ## 1 male 32.58267 41.88626 3 1 fired ## 2 female 41.21104 36.34339 2 5 fired ## 3 male 37.70516 36.81718 3 0 fired ## 4 female 30.06051 38.96032 3 2 fired str(HR) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 7847 obs. of 6 variables: ## $ gender : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;: 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 1 ... ## $ age : num 32.6 41.2 37.7 30.1 21.1 ... ## $ hours : num 41.9 36.3 36.8 39 62.2 ... ## $ evaluation: num 3 2 3 3 5 2 4 2 2 4 ... ## $ salary : num 1 5 0 2 3 0 0 4 4 4 ... ## $ status : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;fired&quot;,&quot;ok&quot;,&quot;promoted&quot;: 1 1 1 1 3 1 3 2 1 3 ... table(HR$evaluation) ## ## 2 3 4 5 ## 2371 2272 1661 1543 table(HR$salary) ## ## 0 1 2 3 4 5 ## 1105 1417 1461 1508 1316 1040 Models considered for this dataset will use status as the (categorical) dependent variable. 4.3.1 Data exploration As it was the case for the apartments dataset (see Section 4.2), the HR data were simulated. Despite the fact that characteristics of the data are known, we conduct some data exploration to illustrate the important aspects of the data. Figure 4.16 indicates that young females and older males were fired more frequently than older females and younger males. Figure 4.16: Employment status for age-groups and gender. Figure 4.17 indicates that the proportion of promoted employees was the lowest for the lowest and highest salary level. At the same time, the proportion of fired employees was the highest for the two salary levels. Figure 4.17: Employment status for different salary levels. Figure 4.18 indicates that the chance of being fired was larger for evaluation scores equal to 2 or 3. On the other hand, the chance of being promoted substantially increased for scores equal to 4 or 5. Figure 4.18: Employment status for different evaluation scores. 4.3.2 Multinomial logistic regression The dependent variable of interest, status, is categorical with three categories. Thus, a simple choice is to consider a multinomial logistic regression model (Venables and Ripley 2010). We fit the model with the help of function multinom from package nnet. The function fits multinomial log-linear models by using the neural-networks approach. As a result, we obtain a complex model that is smoother as compared to a random forest model that relies on binary splits for continuous variables. We treat all variables other than status in the HR data frame as explanatory and include them in the model. The results of the model are stored in model-object HR_glm_v5. library(&quot;nnet&quot;) set.seed(1313) HR_glm_v5 &lt;- multinom(status ~ gender + age + hours + evaluation + salary, data = HR) ## # weights: 21 (12 variable) ## initial value 8620.810629 ## iter 10 value 7002.127738 ## iter 20 value 6239.478146 ## iter 20 value 6239.478126 ## iter 20 value 6239.478124 ## final value 6239.478124 ## converged HR_glm_v5 ## Call: ## multinom(formula = status ~ gender + age + hours + evaluation + ## salary, data = HR) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) gendermale age hours evaluation ## ok -3.199741 0.05185293 0.001003521 0.06628055 -0.03734345 ## promoted -12.677639 0.11838037 0.003436872 0.16253343 1.26109093 ## salary ## ok 0.01680039 ## promoted 0.01507927 ## ## Residual Deviance: 12478.96 ## AIC: 12502.96 4.3.3 Random forest As an alternative to multinomial logistic regression, we consider a random forest model. To fit the model, we apply the randomForest() function, with default settings, from the package with the same name (Liaw and Wiener 2002b). The results of the model are stored in model-object HR_rf_v5. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) set.seed(1313) HR_rf_v5 &lt;- randomForest(status ~ gender + age + hours + evaluation + salary, data = HR) HR_rf_v5 ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = status ~ gender + age + hours + evaluation + salary, data = HR) ## Type of random forest: classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 2 ## ## OOB estimate of error rate: 27.46% ## Confusion matrix: ## fired ok promoted class.error ## fired 2270 388 197 0.2049037 ## ok 530 1243 448 0.4403422 ## promoted 202 390 2179 0.2136413 4.3.4 Model predictions Let us now compare predictions that are obtained from the multinomial regression and random forest models. In particular, we compute the predicted probabilities of being fired, retained in service, or promoted for Dilbert, a 58-year old male working around 42 hours per week for a salary at level 2, who got evaluation score equal to 2. Data frame dilbert contains the data describing the employee. dilbert &lt;- data.frame(gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;)), age = 57.7, hours = 42.3, evaluation = 2, salary = 2) By aplying the predict() function to model-objects HR_rf_v5 and HR_glm_v5, with dilbert as the data frame for which predictions are to be computed, and argument type=\"prob\", we obtain the predicted probabilities of being fired, retained in service, or promoted for Dilbert. pred_HR_rf &lt;- predict(HR_rf_v5, dilbert, type = &quot;prob&quot;) pred_HR_rf ## fired ok promoted ## 1 0.778 0.218 0.004 ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;votes&quot; pred_HR_glm &lt;- predict(HR_glm_v5, dilbert, type = &quot;prob&quot;) pred_HR_glm ## fired ok promoted ## 0.56369601 0.40630786 0.02999612 For both models, the predicted probability of promotion is low; it is more likely that Dilbert will be fired. It is of interest to understand why such prediction is made? Moreover, random forest yields a higher probability of firing (0.78) than the multinomial regression model (0.56). We may want to learn where does this difference come from? We will try to answer these questions in subsequent chapters. 4.3.5 List of objects for the HR example In Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3 we have built two predictive models for the HR data set. The models will be used in the remainder of the book to illustrate model-explanation methods and tools. For the ease of reference, we summarize the models in Table 4.4.

["InstanceLevelExploration.html", "Chapter 5 Instance-level exploration", " Chapter 5 Instance-level exploration Figure 5.1: (fig:localDALEXsummary) Summary of differnet approaches to local model exploration and explanation. Instance-level explainers help to understand how a model yields a prediction for a single observation. We can think about the following situations as examples: We may want to evaluate the effects of explanatory variables on model predictions. For instance, we may be interested in predicting the risk of heart attack based on person’s age, sex, and smoking habits. A model may be used to construct a score (for instance, a linear combination of the explanatory variables representing age, sex, and smoking habits) that could be used for the purposes of prediction. For a particular patient we may want to learn how much the different variables contribute to the patient’s score? We may want to understand how models predictions would change if values of some of the explanatory variables changed. For instance, what would be the predicted risk of heart attack if the patient cut the number of cigarettes smoked per day by half? We may discover that the model is providing incorrect predictions and we may want to find the reason. For instance, a patient with a very low risk-score experiences heart attack. What has driven that prediction? A model is a function with a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector \\(x\\) as an argument. The plot of the value(s) of the function can be constructed in a \\(p+1\\)-dimensional space. An example with \\(p=2\\) is presented in Figure 5.2. We will use it as an illustration of key ideas. The plot provides an information about the values of the function in the vicinity of point \\(x^*\\). Figure 5.2: (fig:cutsSurfaceReady) Response surface for a model that is a function of two variables. We are interested in understanding the response of a model in a single point x* There are many different tools that may be used to explore the predictions of the model around a single point \\(x^*\\). In the following sections we will describe the most popular approaches. They can be divided into three classes. One approach is to investigate how the model prediction changes if the value of a single explanatory variable changes. The approach is useful in the so-called ,,What-If’’ analyses. In particular, we can construct plots presenting the change in model-based predictions induced by a change of a single variable. Such plots are usually called Ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles. An example is provided in panel A of Figure 5.3. Chapters 6-8 introduce the CP profiles and methods based on them. Another approach is to analyze how the model prediction for point \\(x^*\\) is different from the average model prediction and how the difference can be distributed among explanatory variables. It is often called the ,,variable attributions’’ approach. An example is provided in panel B of Figure 5.3. Chapters 9-11 present various methods implementing this approach. Yet another approach is to analyze the curvature of the response surface (see Figure 5.2) around the point of interest \\(x^*\\). Treating the model as a function, we are interested in the local behavior of this function around \\(x^*\\). In case of a black-box model, we may approximate it with a simpler glass-box model around \\(x^*\\). An example is provided in panel C of Figure 5.3. Chapter 12 presents the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method that exploits the concept of a ,,local model.’’ Each method has its own merits and limitations. They are briefly discussed in the corresponding chapters. Chapter ?? offers a comparison of the methods. Figure 5.3: (fig:cutsTechnikiReady) Illustration of different approaches to instance-level explanation. Panel A presents a What-If analysis with Ceteris-paribus profiles. The profiles show the model response as a function of a value of a single variable, while keeping the values of all other explanatory variables fixed. Panel B illustrates the concept of variable attributions. Additive effects of each variable show how the model response differs from the average. Panel C illustrates the concept of local models. A simpler glass-box model is fitted around the point of interest. It describes the local behaviour of the black-box model. "],
["ceterisParibus.html", "Chapter 6 Ceteris-paribus Profiles and What-If Analysis 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Intuition 6.3 Method 6.4 Example: Titanic 6.5 Pros and cons 6.6 Code snippets for R", " Chapter 6 Ceteris-paribus Profiles and What-If Analysis 6.1 Introduction Ceteris paribus is a Latin phrase meaning “other things held constant” or “all else unchanged.” In this chapter, we introduce a technique for model exploration based on the Ceteris paribus principle. In particular, we examine the influence of each explanatory variable, assuming that effects of all other variables are unchanged. The main goal is to understand how changes in a single explanatory variable affects model predictions. Explanation tools (explainers) presented in this chapter are linked to the second law introduced in Section 1.3, i.e. the law of “Prediction’s speculation.” This is why the tools are also known as What-If model analysis or Individual Conditional Expectations (Goldstein et al. 2015a). It appears that it is easier to understand how a black-box model is working if we can explore the model by investigating the influence of explanatory variables separately, changing one at a time. 6.2 Intuition Panel A of Figure 6.1 presents response (prediction) surface for the titanic_lmr_v6 model for two explanatory variables, age and class, from the titanic dataset (see Section 4.1). We are interested in the change of the model prediction induced by each of the variables. Toward this end, we may want to explore the curvature of the response surface around a single point with age equal to 47 and class equal to “1st,” indicated in the plot. Ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles are one-dimensional profiles that examine the curvature across each dimension, i.e., for each variable. Panel B of Figure 6.1 presents the profiles corresponding to age and class. Note that, in the CP profile for age, the point of interest is indicated by the black dot. In essence, a CP profile shows a conditional expectation of the dependent variable (response) for the particular explanatory variable. Figure 6.1: (fig:modelResponseCurveLine) A) Model response (prediction) surface. Ceteris-paribus (CP) profiles marked with black curves help to understand the curvature of the surface while changing only a single explanatory variable. B) CP profiles for individual variables, age (continuous) and class (categorical). CP technique is similar to the LIME method (see Chapter 12). LIME and CP profiles examine the curvature of response surface of a model. The difference between these two methods lies in the fact that LIME approximates the black-box model of interest locally with a simpler glass-box model. Usually, the LIME model is sparse, i.e., contains fewer explanatory variables. Thus, one needs to investigate a plot across a smaller number of dimensions. On the other hand, the CP profiles present conditional predictions for every variable and, in most cases, are easier to interpret. 6.3 Method In this section, we introduce more formally one-dimensional CP profiles. In predictive modeling, we are interested in a distribution of a dependent variable \\(Y\\) given vector \\(x_*\\). The latter contains values of explanatory variables. In the ideal world, we would like to know the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) given \\(x_*\\). In practical applications, however, we usually do not predict the entire distribution, but just some of its characteristics like the expected (mean) value, a quantile, or variance. Without loss of generality we will assume that we model the conditional expected value \\(E_Y(Y | x_*)\\). Assume that we have got model \\(f()\\), for which \\(f(x_*)\\) is an approximation of \\(E_Y(Y | x_*)\\), i.e., \\(E_Y(Y | x_*) \\approx f(x_*)\\). Note that we do not assume that it is a “good” model, nor that the approximation is precise. We simply assume that we have got a model that is used to estimate the conditional expected value and to form predictions of the values of the dependent variable. Our interest lies in the evaluation of the quality of the predictions. If the model offers a “good” approximation of the conditional expected value, it should be reflected in its satisfactory predictive performance. Recall (see Section 1.8) that we use \\(x_i\\) to refer to the vector corresponding to the \\(i\\)-th observation in a dataset. Let \\(x^{j}_{*}\\) denote the \\(j\\)-th element of \\(x_{*}\\), i.e., the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. We use \\(x^{-j}_{*}\\) to refer to a vector resulting from removing the \\(j\\)-th element from \\(x_{*}\\). By \\(x^{j|=z}_{*}\\), we denote a vector resulting from changing the value of the \\(j\\)-th element of \\(x_{*}\\) to (a scalar) \\(z\\). We define a one-dimensional CP profile \\(h()\\) for model \\(f()\\), the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable, and point \\(x_*\\) as follows: \\[ h^{f,j}_{x_*}(z) \\equiv f(x_*^{j|=z}). \\] CP profile is a function that provides the dependence of the approximated expected value (prediction) of \\(Y\\) on the value \\(z\\) of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. Note that, in practice, \\(z\\) is taken to go through the entire range of values typical for the variable, while values of all other explanatory variables are kept fixed at the values specified by \\(x_*\\). Note that in the situation when only a single model is considered, we will skip the model index and we will denote the CP profile for the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable and the point of interest \\(x_*\\) by \\(h^{j}_{x_*}(z)\\). 6.4 Example: Titanic For continuous explanatory variables, a natural way to represent the CP function is to use a profile plot similar to the ones presented in Figure 6.2. In the figure, the dot on the curves marks an instance prediction, i.e., prediction \\(f(x_*)\\) for a single observation \\(x_*\\). The curve itself shows how the prediction would change if the value of a particular explanatory variable changed. Figure 6.2 presents CP profiles for the age variable in the logistic regression and random forest models for the Titanic dataset (see Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, respectively). It is worth observing that the profile for the logistic regression model is smooth, while the one for the random forest model shows more variability. For this instance (observation), the prediction for the logistic regression model would increase substantially if the value of age became lower than 20. For the random forrest model, a substantial increase would be obtained if age became lower than 13 or so. Figure 6.2: (fig:profileAgeRf) Ceteris-paribus profiles for variable age for the logistic regression (titanic_lmr_v6) and random forest (titanic_rf_v6 ) models that predict the probability of surviving based on the Titanic data For a categorical explanatory variable, a natural way to represent the CP function is to use a barplot similar to the ones presented in Figure 6.3. The barplots in Figure 6.2 present CP profiles for the class variable in the logistic regression and random forest models for the Titanic dataset (see Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3, respectively). For this instance (observation), the predicted probability for the logistic regression model would decrease substantially if the value of class changed to “2nd”. On the other hand, for the random forest model, the largest change would be marked if class changed to “restaurant staff”. Figure 6.3: (fig:profileAgeRf2) Ceteris-paribus profiles for variable class for the logistic regression (titanic_lmr_v6) and random forest (titanic_rf_v6 ) models that predict the probability of surviving based on the Titanic data Usually, black-box models contain a large number of explanatory variables. However, CP profiles are legible even for tiny subplots, created with techniques like sparklines or small multiples (Tufte 1986). In this way we can display a large number of profiles at the same time keeping profiles for consecutive variables in separate panels, as shown in Figure 6.4 for the random forest model for the Titanic dataset. It helps if these panels are ordered so that the most important profiles are listed first. We discuss a method to assess the importance of CP profiles in the next chapter. Figure 6.4: (fig:profileV4Rf) Ceteris-paribus profiles for all continuous explanatory variables for the random forest (titanic_rf_v6) model for the titanic dataset 6.5 Pros and cons One-dimensional CP profiles, as presented in this chapter, offer a uniform, easy to communicate and extendable approach to model exploration. Their graphical representation is easy to understand and explain. It is possible to show profiles for many variables or models in a single plot. CP profiles are easy to compare, thus we can juxtapose two or more models to better understand differences between models. We can also compare two or more instances to better understand model stability. CP profiles are also a useful tool for sensitivity analysis. There are several issues related to the use of the CP profiles. If explanatory variables are correlated, then changing one variable implies a change in the other. In such case, the application of the Ceteris paribus principle may lead to unrealistic settings, as it is not possible to keep one variable fixed while varying the other one. For example, apartment’s price prediction features like surface and number of rooms are correlated thus it is unrealistic to consider very small apartments with extreme number of rooms. Special cases are interactions, which require the use of two-dimensional CP profiles that are more complex than one-dimensional ones. Also, in case of a model with hundreds or thousands of variables, the number of plots to inspect may be daunting. Finally, while barplots allow visualization of CP profiles for factors (categorical explanatory variables), their use becomes less trivial in case of factors with many nominal (unordered) categories (like, for example, a ZIP-code). 6.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present key features of the R package ingredients (Biecek 2019a) which is a part of DrWhy.AI universe and covers all methods presented in this chapter. More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/ingredients/. Note that there are also other R packages that offer similar functionality, like condvis (O’Connell, Hurley, and Domijan 2017), pdp (Greenwell 2017a), ICEbox (Goldstein et al. 2015b), ALEPlot (Apley 2018a), iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018a). For illustration, we use two classification models developed in Chapter 4.1, namely the logistic regression model titanic_lmr_v6 (Section 4.1.2) and the random forest model titanic_rf_v6 (Section 4.1.3). They are developed to predict the probability of survival after sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for a single observation henry - a 47 years old male passenger that travelled in the 1st class. DALEX explainers for both models and the henry data frame are retrieved via the archivist hooks as listed in Section 4.1.7. library(&quot;rms&quot;) explain_lmr_v6 &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/2b9b6&quot;) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) explain_rf_v6 &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/9b971&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;) henry ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 6.6.1 Basic use of the ceteris_paribus function The easiest way to create and plot CP profiles is to call ceteris_paribus() function and then the generic plot() function. By default, profiles for all variables are being calculated and all numeric features are being plotted. One can limit the number of variables that should be considered with the variables argument. To obtain CP profiles, the ceteris_paribus() function requires the explainer-object and the instance data frame as arguments. As a result, the function yields an object od the class ceteris_paribus_explainer. It is a data frame with model predictions. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) cp_titanic_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, henry) cp_titanic_rf ## Top profiles : ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked _yhat_ _vname_ ## 1 3rd male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.100 class ## 1.1 2nd male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.054 class ## 1.2 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.246 class ## 1.3 engineering crew male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.096 class ## 1.4 victualling crew male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.098 class ## 1.5 restaurant staff male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.092 class ## _ids_ _label_ ## 1 1 Random Forest v6 ## 1.1 1 Random Forest v6 ## 1.2 1 Random Forest v6 ## 1.3 1 Random Forest v6 ## 1.4 1 Random Forest v6 ## 1.5 1 Random Forest v6 ## ## ## Top observations: ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked _yhat_ _label_ ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg 0.246 Random Forest v6 ## _ids_ ## 1 1 To obtain a graphical representation of CP profiles, the generic plot() function can be applied to the data frame returned by the ceteris_paribus() function. It returns a ggplot2 object that can be processed further if needed. In the examples below, we use the ggplot2 functions, like ggtitle() or ylim(), to modify plot’s title or the range of the Y-axis. The resulting plot can be enriched with additional data by applying functions ingredients::show_rugs() (adds rugs for the selected points), ingredients::show_observations (adds dots that shows observations), or ingredients::show_aggreagated_profiles. All these functions can take additional arguments to modify size, color, or linetype. Below we show an R snippet that can be used to replicate plots presented in the upper part of Figure 6.4. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) plot(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + show_observations(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Profiles&quot;, &quot;For the random forest model and the Titanic dataset&quot;) Figure 6.5: Ceteris-paribus profiles for age and fare variables and the titanic_rf_v6 model.

To better understand how it can be used, we briefly review its arguments. x, data, predict_function, label - information about a model. If x is created with the DALEX::explain function, then other arguments are extracted from x; this is how we use the function in this chapter. Otherwise, we have got to specify directly the model, the validation data, the predict function, and the model label. new_observation - instance (one or more), for which we want to calculate CP profiles. It should be a data frame with same variables as in the validation data. y - observed value of the dependent variable for new_observation. The use of this argument is illustrated in Section 8.1. variables - names of explanatory variables, for which CP profiles are to be calculated. By default, the profiles will be constructed for all variables, which may be time consuming. variable_splits - a list of values for which CP profiles are to be calculated. By default, these are all values for categorical variables. For continuous variables, uniformly-placed values are selected; one can specify the number of the values with the grid_points argument (the default is 101). The code below allows to obtain the plots in the upper part of Figure 6.4. The argument variable_splits specifies the variables (age and fare) for which CP profiles are to be calculated, together with the list of values at which the profiles are to be evaluated. cp_titanic_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, henry, variable_splits = list(age = seq(0, 70, 0.1), fare = seq(0, 100, 0.1))) plot(cp_titanic_rf) + show_observations(cp_titanic_rf, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;), size = 5) + ylim(0, 1) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Profiles&quot;, &quot;For the random forest model and titanic dataset&quot;) Figure 6.7: Ceteris-paribus profiles for class and embarked variables and the titanic_rf_v6 model. Blue dot stands for henry. To enhance the plot, additional functions can be used. The generic plot() function creates a ggplot2 object with a single geom_line layer. Function show_observations adds geom_point layer, show_rugs adds geom_rugs, while show_profiles adds another geom_line. All these functions take, as the first argument, an object created with the ceteris_paribus function. They can be combined freely to superpose profiles for different models or observations. In the example below, we present the code to create XO profiles for two passengers, henry and johny_d. Their profiles are included in a plot presented in Figure 6.8. We use the scale_color_manual function to add names of passengers to the plot, and to control colors and positions. johny_d &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/e3596&quot;) cp_titanic_rf2 &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, rbind(henry, johny_d)) plot(cp_titanic_rf2, color = &quot;_ids_&quot;) + show_observations(cp_titanic_rf2, size = 5, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + show_rugs(cp_titanic_rf2, sides = &quot;bl&quot;, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;)) + scale_color_manual(name = &quot;Passenger:&quot;, breaks = 1:2, values = c(&quot;#4378bf&quot;, &quot;#8bdcbe&quot;), labels = c(&quot;henry&quot; , &quot;johny_d&quot;)) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Profiles&quot;, &quot;For the random forest model and the Titanic dataset&quot;) Figure 6.8: Ceteris-paribus profiles for the titanic_rf_v6 model. Profiles for different passangers are color-coded. 6.6.3 Champion-challenger analysis One of the most interesting uses of the explainers is comparison of CP profiles for two or more of models. To illustrate this possibility, first, we have go to construct profiles for the models. In our illustration, for the sake of clarity, we limit ourselves just to two models: the logistic regression and random forest models for the Titanic data. Moreover, we only consider the age and fare variables. We use henry as the instance, for which predictions are of interest. cp_titanic_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, henry) cp_titanic_lmr &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_lmr_v6, henry) Subsequently, we construct the plot. The result is shown in Figure 6.9. Predictions for henry are slightly different, logistic regression returns in this case higher predictions then random forest. For age variable profiles of both models are similar, in both models we see decreasing dependency. While for fare the logistic regression model is slightly positive while random forest is negative. The larger the fare the larger is difference between these models. Such analysis helps us to which degree different models agree on what if scenarios. Note that every plot and show_* function can take a collection of explainers as arguments. Profiles for different models are included in a single plot. In the presented R snippet, models are color-coded with the help of the argument color = \"_label_\", where _label_ refers to the name of the column in the CP explainer that contains the model label. plot(cp_titanic_rf, cp_titanic_lmr, color = &quot;_label_&quot;) + show_observations(cp_titanic_rf, cp_titanic_lmr, color = &quot;black&quot;, variables = c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;), size = 5) + scale_color_discrete(name = &quot;Selected models:&quot;) + ylim(0,1) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Profiles for Henry&quot;) Figure 6.9: Champion-challenger comparison of the titanic_lmr_v6 and titanic_rf_v6 models.

To prioritize between the profiles we need a measure that would summarize the impact of a selected variable on model’s predictions. In this chapter we describe a solution closely linked with CP profiles. An alternative is discussed in the Chapters 9 and 11. 7.2 Intuition To assign importance to CP profiles, we can use the concept of profile oscillations. In particular, the larger influence of an explanatory variable on prediction at a particular instance, the larger the fluctuations along the corresponding CP profile. For a variable that exercises little or no influence on model prediction, the profile will be flat or will barely change. In other words, the values of the CP profile should be close to the value of the model prediction for the particular instance. Consequently, the sum of differences between the profile and the value of the prediction, take across all possible values of the explanatory variable, should be close to zero. The sum can be graphically depicted by the area between the profile and the horizontal line representing the instance prediction. On the other hand, for an explanatory variable with a large influence on the prediction, the area should be large. Figure 7.1 illustrates the concept. Panle A of the figure corresponds to the CP profiles presented in Figure 6.4. The larger the highlighted area in Figure 7.1, the more important is the variable for the particular prediction. Figure 7.1: (fig:CPVIPprofiles) The value of the colored area summarizes the Ceteris-paribus-profile oscillations and provides the mean of the absolute deviations between the CP profile and the instance prediction. Panel A shows plots for continuous explanatory variables, while panel B shows plots for categorical variables in the titanic_rf_v6 model. 7.3 Method Let us formalize this concept now. Denote by \\(g^j(z)\\) the probability density function of the distribution of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. The summary measure of the variable’s importance for model prediction at point \\(x_*\\), \\(vip_{CP}^{j}(x_*)\\), computed based on the variable’s CP profile, is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} vip_{CP}^j(x_*) = \\int_{\\mathcal R} |h^{j}_{x_*}(z) - f(x_*)| g^j(z)dz=E_{X^j}\\left[|h^{j}_{x_*}(X^j) - f(x_*)|\\right]. \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, \\(vip_{CP}^j(x_*)\\) is the expected absolute deviation of the CP profile from the model prediction for \\(x_*\\) over the distribution \\(g^j(z)\\) for the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. The true distribution of \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable is, in most cases, unknown. Thus, there are several options how to calculate (7.1). One is to calculate just the area under the CP curve, i.e., to assume that \\(g^j(z)\\) is a uniform distribution for the range of variable \\(x^j\\). It folows then that a straightforward estimator of \\(vip_{CP}^{j,uni}(x_*)\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(x_*) = \\frac 1k \\sum_{l=1}^k |h^{j}_{x_*}(z_l) - f(x_*)|, \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(z_l\\) (\\(l=1, \\ldots, k\\)) are the selected values of the \\(j\\)-th explanatory variable. For instance, one can select use all unique values of \\(x^{j}\\) in the considered dataset. Alternatively, for a continuous variable, one can use an equi-distant grid of values. Another approach is to use the empirical distribution for \\(x^{j}\\). This leads to the estimator of \\(vip_{CP}^{j,emp}(x_*)\\) defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(x_*) = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n |h^{j}_{x_*}(x^{j}_i) - f(x_*)|, \\tag{7.3} \\end{equation}\\] where index \\(i\\) goes through all observations in a dataset. The use of of \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(x_*)\\) is preferred when there are enough data to accurately estimate the empirical distribution and when the distribution is not uniform. On the other hand, \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(x_*)\\) is in most cases quicker to compute and, therefore, it is preferred if we look for fast approximations. It is worth noting that the importance of an explanatory variable for instance prediction may be very different for different points \\(x_*\\). For example, consider model \\[ f(x_1, x_2) = x_1 * x_2, \\] where \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) take values in \\([0,1]\\). Consider prediction for an observation described by vector \\(x_* = (0,1)\\). In that case, the importance of \\(X_1\\) is larger than \\(X_2\\). This is because the CP profile for the first variable, given by the values of function \\(f(z,1)=z\\), will have oscillations. On the other hand, the profile for the second variable will show no oscillations, because the profile is given by function \\(f(0,z)=0\\). Obviously, the situation is reversed for \\(x_*=(1,0)\\). 7.4 Example: Titanic Figure 7.2 provides a barplot of variable importance measures for different continuous explanatory variables for the random forest model titanic_rf_v6 for henry. The longer the bar, the larger the CP-profile oscillations for a particular explanatory variable. Thus, Figure 7.2 indicates that the most important variable for prediction for the selected observation are gender and sibsp, followed by age. From the Ceteris Paribus one can read that if Henry were older, this would significantly lower the chance of survival. One the other hand, were Henry not travelling alone, this would increase the chance. From the oscillation’s plot one can only read which features are important but one cannot read how they influence the prediction. This is why profile oscillations shall be accompanied by Ceteris Paribus profiles. Figure 7.2: (fig:CPVIP1) Variable-importance measures calculated for Ceteris-paribus oscillations for henry based on the titanic_rf_v6 model 7.5 Pros and cons Oscillations of CP profiles are easy to interpret and understand. By using the average of oscillations, it is possible to select the most important variables for an instance prediction. The methodology can easily be extended to two or more variables. There are several issues related to the use of the CP oscillations. For example, the oscillations may not be of help in situations when the use of CP profiles may itself be problematic (e.g., in the case of correlated explanatory variables or interactions - see Section 6.5). An important issue is that the local variable importance do not sum up to the instance prediction for which they are calculated. In Chapters 9 and 11, we will introduce measures that address this problem. 7.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we present key features of R package ingredients which is a part of the DrWhy.AI universe and covers all methods presented in this chapter. More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/ingredients/. For illustration purposes we use the random forest model titanic_rf_v6 (see Section ??). Recall that it is developed to predict the probability of survival from sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for a single observation: henry - a 47-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class. DALEX explainers for both models and the Henry data are retrieved via archivist hooks as listed in Section 4.1.7. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) explain_rf_v6 &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/9b971&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;) henry 7.6.1 Basic use of the calculate_oscillations function To calculate CP oscillations, we have got to calculate CP profiles for the selected observation. We use henry as the instance prediction of interest. CP profiles are calculated by applying the ceteris_paribus() function to the wrapper object. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) cp_titanic_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, henry) The resulting object can subsequently be processed with the calculate_oscillations() function to calculate the oscillations and the estimated value of the variable-importance measure (7.1). oscillations_titanic_rf &lt;- calculate_oscillations(cp_titanic_rf) oscillations_titanic_rf ## _vname_ _ids_ oscillations ## 2 gender 1 0.33700000 ## 4 sibsp 1 0.15500000 ## 3 age 1 0.14700000 ## 1 class 1 0.14257143 ## 6 fare 1 0.05407273 ## 7 embarked 1 0.02400000 ## 5 parch 1 0.00800000 Note that, by default, calculate_oscillations() estimates \\(vip_{CP}^j(x_*)\\) by \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(x_*)\\), given in (7.2), using all unique values of the explanatory variable as the grid points. The calculate_oscillations() function returns an object of class ceteris_paribus_oscillations, which has a form of a data frame, but has also an overloaded plot() function. We can use the latter function to plot the local variable-importance measures for the instance of interest. oscillations_titanic_rf$`_ids_` &lt;- &quot;Henry&quot; plot(oscillations_titanic_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Oscillations&quot;) 7.6.2 Advanced use of the calculate_oscillations function As mentioned in the previous section, calculate_oscillations() estimates \\(vip_{CP}^j(x_*)\\) by \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(x_*)\\) using all unique values of the explanatory variable as the grid points. However, other approaches are also possible. One is to use \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,uni}(x_*)\\), but assuming an equi-distant grid of values for a continuous explanatory variable. Toward this aim, we have got to explicitly specify a dense uniform grid of values for such a variable. The variable_splits argument can be used for this purpose. cp_titanic_rf_uniform &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, henry, variable_splits = list(age = seq(0, 65, 0.1), fare = seq(0, 200, 0.1), sibsp = seq(0, 8, 0.1), parch = seq(0, 8, 0.1), gender = unique(titanic$gender), embarked = unique(titanic$embarked), class = unique(titanic$class))) Subsequently, we apply the calculate_oscillations() function to compute the oscillations and the variable-importance measures. oscillations_uniform &lt;- calculate_oscillations(cp_titanic_rf_uniform) oscillations_uniform$`_ids_` &lt;- &quot;Henry&quot; oscillations_uniform ## _vname_ _ids_ oscillations ## 5 gender Henry 0.3370000 ## 3 sibsp Henry 0.1677778 ## 1 age Henry 0.1677235 ## 7 class Henry 0.1425714 ## 2 fare Henry 0.1040790 ## 6 embarked Henry 0.0240000 ## 4 parch Henry 0.0100000 plot(oscillations_uniform) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris Paribus Oscillations&quot;, &quot;Expectation over uniform distribution&quot;) Another approach is to calculate the expectation (7.1) over the empirical distribution of a variable, i..e, to use \\(\\widehat{vip}_{CP}^{j,emp}(x_*)\\), given in (7.3).

In this chapter, we present two local-diagnostics techniques that can address this issue. In particular, we focus on fidelity plots: the plot of CP profiles for nearest neighbors and the local-fidelity plot. The idea behind fidelity plots is to select a number of observations (“neighbors”) from the validation dataset that are closest to the instance (observation) of interest. Then, for the selected observations, we plot CP profiles and check how stable they are. Additionally, if we know true values of the dependent variable for the selected neighbors, we may add residuals to the plot to evaluate the local fit of the model. 8.2 Intuition One approach to local model diagnostics is to examine how the predictions vary for observations from the training dataset. Figure 8.1 presents CP profiles for the instance of interest and its 10 nearest neighbors for the random forest model for the Titanic dataset (Section 4.1.3). The profiles are almost parallel and very close to each other. This suggests that model predictions are stable around the instance of interest, because small changes in the explanatory variables (represented by the nearest neighbors) have not got much influence on the predictions. Figure 8.1: (fig:profileWith10NN) Ceteris-paribus profiles for a selected instance (dark violet line) and 10 nearest neighbors (light grey lines) for the titanic_rf_b6 model. The profiles are almost parallel and close to each other what suggests the stability of the model. Once we have selected the nearest neighbors, we can also look closer at the model fit around the point of interest. Figure 8.2 presents histograms of residuals for the entire dataset and the selected neighbors for the random forest model for the Apartments dataset (Section 4.2.3). The distribution of residuals for the entire dataset is rather symmetric and centered around 0, suggesting a reasonable average performance of the model. On the other hand, the residuals for the selected neighbors are centered around the value of 500. This sugests that, on average, the model predictions are biased for the instance of interest. Figure 8.2: (fig:profileBack2BackHist) Histograms of residuals for the apartments_rf_v5 model for the Apartments dataset. Upper panel: residuals calculated for all observations from the dataset. Bottom panel: residuals calculated for 25 nearest neighbors of the instance of interest. 8.3 Method The proposed method is based on three elements: identification of nearest neighbors, calculation and visualization of CP profiles for the selected neighbors, and analysis of residuals for the neighbors. In what follows we discuss each of the elements in more detail. 8.3.1 Nearest neighbors There are two important questions related to the selection of the neighbors “nearest” to the instance (observation) of interest: How many neighbors should we choose? What metric should be used to measure the “proximity” of observations? The answer to both questions is, of course, it depends. The smaller the number of neighbors, the more local is the analysis. However, a very small number will lead to a larger variability of the results. In many cases we found that 20 neighbors works fine. However, one should always take into account computational time (smaller number of neighbors results in quicker calculations) and the size of the dataset (for a small dataset, smaller sets of neighbors may be preferred). The metric if very important. The more explanatory variables, the more important is the choice. In particular, the metric should be capable of accommodating variables of different nature (categorical, continuous). Our default choice is the Gower similarity measure: \\[ d_{gower}(x_i, x_j) = \\frac 1p \\sum_{k=1}^p d^k(x_i^k, x_j^k), \\] where \\(x_i\\) is a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector of explanatory covariates for the \\(i\\)-th observation and \\(d^k(x_i^k,x_j^k)\\) is the distance between values of the \\(k\\)-th variable for the \\(i\\)-th and \\(j\\)-th observations. Note that \\(d^k()\\) depends on the nature of the variable. For instance, for a continuous variable it is equal to \\(|x_i^k-x_j^k|/\\{max(x_1^k,\\ldots,x_n^k)-min(x_1^k,\\ldots,x_n^k)\\}\\), i.e., the absolute difference scaled by the observed range of the variable. On the other hand, for a categorical variable, it is simply \\(I(x_i^k = x_j^k)\\), where \\(I()\\) is the indicator function. Note that \\(p\\) may be equal to the number of all explanatory variables included in the model, or only a subset of them. Once we have decided on the number of neighbors, we can use the chosen metric to select the required number observations “closest” to the one of interest. 8.3.2 Profiles for neighbors Once nearest neighbors have been identified, we can graphically compare CP profiles for selected (or all) variables. For a model with a large number of variables, we may end up with a large number of plots. In such a case a better strategy is to focus only on \\(K\\) most important variables, selected by using the variable-importance measure (see Chapter 7). 8.3.3 Local-fidelity plot CP profiles are helpful to assess the model stability. In addition, we can enhance the plot by adding residuals to it to allow evaluation of the local model fit. For model \\(f()\\) and observation \\(i\\) described by the vector of explanatory variables \\(x_i\\), the residual is the difference between the observed and predicted value of the dependent variable \\(Y_i\\), i.e., \\[ r_i = y_i - f(x_i). \\] Note that, for a binary variable, the residual is the difference between the value of 0 or 1, depending on how we code “success,” and the value of the predicted probability of “success.” This defintion also applies to categorical responses, as it is common to define, in such case, a binary “success” indicator and compute the predicted probaiblity of “success” for each category separately. The plot that includes CP profiles for the nearest neighbors and the corresponding residuals is called a local-fidelity plot. 8.4 Example: Titanic As an example, we will use the predictions for the random forest model for the Titanic data (see Section 4.1.3). Figure 8.3 presents a detailed explanation of the elements of a local-fidelity plot for age, a continuous explanatory variable. The plot includes eight nearest neighbors of Henry (see Section 4.1.5). Profiles are quite apart from each other, which indicates potential instability of model predictions. However, the residuals included in the plots are positive and negative, indicating that, on average, the instance prediction should not be biased. Figure 8.4 presents a local-fidelity plot for the categorical explanatory variable class. Henry and his neighbors traveled in the 1st class. In different panels we see how the predicted probabilityof survival changes if the 1st class is replaced, for instance, by the 2nd (in most cases, they probability will be reduced) or the deck crew (in most cases, the probability will increase). Such plots can help to detect interactions, as we see that the same change (let’s say, from the 1st to the 3rd class) results in a different change of the model prediction. Figure 8.3: (fig:localFidelityPlots) Elements of a local-fidelity plot for a continuous explanatory variable. The green line shows the Ceteris-paribus profile for the instance of interest. Profiles of the nearest neighbors are marked with grey lines. The vertical intervals correspond to residuals; the shorter the interval, the smaller the residual and the more accurate prediction of the model. Blue intervals correspond to positive residuals, red intervals to negative intervals. Stable model will have profiles close to each other; additive model will have parallel lines. Figure 8.4: (fig:localFidelityPlots2) The local-fidelity plot for the categorical explanatory variable class in the random effects model for the Titanic data, Henry, and his 10 neighbors. Each panel indicates how the model prediction would change if the class changed from 1st to another one. Dots indicate original model predictions for the neighbors; the end of the interval corresponds to model prediction after changing the class. The top-lef panel indicates that, for the majority of the neighbors, the change from the 1st to the 2nd class reduces the predicted value of the probability of survival. On the other hand, the top-right panel indicates that changing the lass to deck crew members increases the predicted probability. 8.5 Pros and cons Local-fidelity plots may be very helpful to check if the model is locally additive, as for such models the CP profiles should be parallel; the model is locally stable, as in that case the CP profiles should be close to each other; the model fit for the instance of interest is good, as in that case the residuals should be small and their distribution should be balanced around 0. The drawback is that such plots are quite complex and lack objective measures of the quality of the model fit. Thus, they are mainly suitable for an exploratory analysis. 8.6 Code snippets for R In this section, we show how to use the R package ingredients (Biecek 2019b) to construct local-fidelity plots. More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/ingredients/. We use the random forest model titanic_rf_v6 developed for the Titanic dataset (see Section 4.1.3 ) as the example. Recall that we try to address a classification problem for a binary dependent variable - we want to predict the probability of survival for a selected passenger. DALEX explainers for the model and the henry data frame are retrieved via archivist hooks, as listed in Section 4.1.7. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) explain_rf_v6 &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/9b971&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) henry &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/a6538&quot;) henry ## class gender age sibsp parch fare embarked ## 1 1st male 47 0 0 25 Cherbourg We will show how to construct Figure 8.1. Toward this aim we need some number of passengers most similar to henry. To select the ‘’neighbors’’, we use the select_neighbours() function from the ingredients package. It returns n observations (by default, 20) most similar to the observation of interest according to the distance measure (by default, the Gower distance is used). In the example below, we select 10 nearest neighbors to henry find from the titanic dataset. Note that the similarity is based only on two explanatory variables, gender, and class, as indicated in the argument variables. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) henry_neighbors &lt;- select_neighbours(henry, data = titanic, n = 10, variables = c(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;)) Now we are ready to plot profiles for Henry and his neighbors. First, we have got to calculate the corresponding profiles with ceteris_paribus() function introduced in Section 6.6. cp_henry &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, henry, variable_splits = list(age = seq(0,80,0.1))) cp_henry_neighbors &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_rf_v6, henry_neighbors, variable_splits = list(age = seq(0,80,0.1))) Subsequently, we can plot the profiles. Note that, in the example below, we do this only for a single variable age. library(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) plot(cp_henry_neighbors, color = &#39;#ceced9&#39;) + # show_profiles(cp_henry, size = 2) + ggtitle(&quot;Ceteris-paribus profiles for Henry and neighbors&quot;, &quot;Calculated for the titanic_rf_v6 model&quot;) To construct the local-fidelity plot presented in Figure 8.3, we have got to add the information about the observed values of the dependent variable for the selected neighbors. Toward this aim, we use the y argument in the ceteris_paribus() function. The argument takes numerical values.

The main disadvantage of this method is that the sum of the developed importance scores does not equal the final model prediction. In this chapter we introduce Break-down (BD) plots, which offer a solution to this problem. Note that the method is similar to the EXPLAIN algorithm introduced in (Robnik-Šikonja and Kononenko 2008) and implemented in the ExplainPrediction package (Robnik-Sikonja 2018). [TOMASZ: DIFFERENCE IN THE NAME IN THE REFERENCES.] 9.1 Intuition The underlying idea is to calculate contribution of an explanatory variable to model’s prediction as a shift in the expected model response after conditioning on other variables. [TOMASZ: PERHAPS BRING SOME PART OF THE LINEAR MODEL HERE?.] The idea is illustrated in Figure 9.1. Consider the prediction for johny_d for the random-forest model (see Section @ref{model-titanic-rf}) for the Titanic data. [TOMASZ: ISSUE - JOHNY_D EMABRKED IN BELFAST, NOT IN SOUTHAMPTON.] Panel A shows distribution of model predictions. The row all data shows the distribution of the predictions for the entire dataset. The red dot indicates the average and it is an estimate of the expected model prediction \\(E_X[f(X)]\\) over the distribution of all explanatory variables. To evaluate the contribution of the explanatory variables to the particular instance prediction, we consider the predictions when fixing the values of the variables. For instance, the row class=1st in Panel A of Figure 9.1 presents the distribution of the predictions obtained when the value of the class variable has been fixed to the 1st class. Again, the red dot indicates the average of the predictions. The next row (age=8) shows the distribution and the average predictions with the value of variable class set to 1st and age set to 8, and so on. The last row corresponds to the prediction for model response forjohny_d`. The black lines in Panel A show how the inidividual predictions change after the value of the \\(j\\)-th variable has been replaced by the value indicated in the name of the row. Eventually, however, we may be interested in the average predictions, as indicated in Panel B of Figure 9.1, or even only in the changes of the averages, as shown in Panel C. In Panel C, positive changes are presented with green bars, while negative differences are marked with red bar. The changes sum up to the final prediction, which is illustrated by the violet bar at the bottom of Panel C. [TOMASZ: I LACK SOME SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENTS/INTERPRETATION OF THE PLOTS.] Figure 9.1: (fig:BDPrice4) Break-down plots show how the contribution of individual explanatory variables change the average model prediction to the prediction for a single instance (observation). Panel A) The first row shows the distribution and the average (red dot) of model predictions for all data. The next rows show the dirstribution and the average of the predictions when fixing values of subseqeunt explanatory variables. The last row shows the prediction for a particular instance of interest. B) Red dots indicate the average predictions from Panel B. C) The green and red bars indicate, resspectively, positive and negative changes in the average predictions (variable contributions). 9.2 Method Let \\(v(j, x_*)\\) denote the variable-importance measure of the \\(j\\)-th variable and instance \\(x_*\\), i.e., the contribution of the \\(j\\)-th variable to prediction at \\(x_*\\). We would like the sum of the variable-importance measures for all explanatory variables to be equal to the instance prediction (property called local accuracy), so that \\[ f(x_*) = v_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^p v(j, x_*), \\] where \\(v_0\\) denotes the average model response. If we re-write the equation above as follows: \\[ E_X[f(X)|X^1 = x^1_*, \\ldots, X^p = x^p_*] = E_X[f(X)] + \\sum_{j=1}^p v(j, x_*), \\] then a natural proposal for \\(v(j, x_*)\\) is \\[ v(j, x_*) = E_X[f(X) | X^1 = x^1_*, \\ldots, X^j = x^j_*] - E_X[f(X) | X^1 = x^1_*, \\ldots, X^{j-1} = x^{j-1}_*]. \\] In other words, the contribution of the \\(j\\)-th variable is the difference between the expected value of the prediction conditional on setting the values of the first \\(j\\) variables equal to their values in \\(x_*\\) and the expected value conditional on setting the values of the first \\(j-1\\) variables equal to their values in \\(x_*\\). Note that the definition does imply the dependence of \\(v(j, x_*)\\) on the order of the explanatory variables that is reflected in their indices. To consider more general cases, let \\(J\\) denote a subset of \\(K\\) (\\(K\\leq p\\)) indices from \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\), i.e., \\(J=\\{j_1,j_2,\\ldots,j_K\\}\\) where each \\(j_k \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\). Furthermore, let \\(L\\) denote another subset of \\(M\\) (\\(M \\leq p-K\\)) indices from \\({1,2,\\ldots,p}\\) distinct from \\(J\\). That is, \\(L=\\{l_1,l_2,\\ldots,l_M\\}\\) where each \\(l_m \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\) and \\(J \\cap L = \\emptyset\\). Let us define now \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\Delta^{L|J}(x_*) &amp;\\equiv&amp; E_X[f(X) | X^{l_1} = x_*^{l_1},\\ldots,X^{l_M} = x_*^{l_M},X^{j_1} = x_*^{j_1},\\ldots,X^{j_K} = x_*^{j_K}]\\\\ &amp;-&amp; E_X[f(X) | X^{j_1} = x_*^{j_1},\\ldots,X^{j_K} = x_*^{j_K}]. \\end{eqnarray}\\] In other words, \\(\\Delta^{L|J}(x_*)\\) is the change between the expected prediction when setting the values of the explanatory variables with indices from the set \\(J \\cup L\\) equal to their values in \\(x_*\\) and the expected prediction conditional on setting the values of the explanatory variables with indices from the set \\(J\\) equal to their values in \\(x_*\\). In particular, for the \\(l\\)-th explanatory variable, let \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\Delta^{l|J}(x_*) \\equiv \\Delta^{\\{l\\}|J}(x_*) &amp;=&amp; E_X[f(X) | X^{l} = x_*^{l},X^{j_1} = x_*^{j_1},\\ldots,X^{j_K} = x_*^{j_K}]\\\\ &amp;-&amp; E_X[f(X) | X^{j_1} = x_*^{j_1},\\ldots,X^{j_K} = x_*^{j_K}]. \\end{eqnarray}\\] Thus, \\(\\Delta^{l|J}\\) is the change between the expected prediction when setting the values of the explanatory variables with indices from the set \\(J \\cup \\{l\\}\\) equal to their values in \\(x_*\\) and the expected prediction conditional on setting the values of the explanatory variables with indices from the set \\(J\\) equal to their values in \\(x_*\\). Note that, if \\(J=\\emptyset\\), then \\[ \\Delta^{l|\\emptyset}(x_*) = E_X[f(X) | X^{l} = x_*^{l}] - E_X[f(X)]. \\] It follows that \\[ v(j, x_*) = \\Delta^{j|\\{1, ..., j-1\\}}(x_*). \\] Unfortunately, for non-additive models (that include interactions), the value of so-defined variable-importance measure depends on the order, in which one sets the values of the explanatory variables. Figure 9.2 presents an example. [TOMASZ: LOOKS LIKE A MODEL FOR THE HR DATA. WHICH ONE?]. For the first ordering, the contribution of variable age is equal to 0.01, while for the second ordering the contribution is equal to 0.13. This is due to the lack of additivity of the model. [TOMASZ: WHICH MODEL? IT HASE NEVER BEEN MENTIONED.] Figure 9.2: (fig:ordering) An illustration of the dependence of the variable-contribution values Black dots stand for conditional average, red arrows stands for changes between conditional averages. There are three approaches that can be used to address the issue of the dependence of \\(v(j, x_*)\\) on the order, in which one sets the values of the explanatory variables. In the first approach, one chooses an ordering according to which the variables with the largest contributions are selected first. In this chapter, we describe a heuristic behind this approach. In the second approach, one identifies the interactions that cause a difference in variable-importance measure for different orderings and focuses on those interactions. This approach is discussed in Chapter 10. Finally, one can calculate an average value of the variance-importance measure across all possible orderings. This approach is presented in Chapter 11. To choose an ordering according to which the variables with the largest contributions are selected first, one can apply a two-step procedure. In the first step, the explanatory variables are ordered. In the second step, the conditioning is applied according to the chosen order of variables. In the first step, the ordering is chosen based on the decreasing value of the scores equal to \\(|\\Delta^{k|\\emptyset}|\\). Note that the absolute value is needed, because the variable contributions can be positive or negative. In the second step, the variable-importance measure for the \\(j\\)-th variable is calculated as \\[ v(j, x_*) = \\Delta ^{j|J}, \\] where \\[ J = \\{k: |\\Delta^{k|\\emptyset}| &lt; |\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}|\\}, \\] that is, \\(J\\) is the set of indices of explanatory variables that have scores \\(|\\Delta^{k|\\emptyset}|\\) smaller than the corresponding score for variable \\(j\\). The time complexity of theeach of the two steps of the procedure is \\(O(p)\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of explanatory variables. 9.3 Example: Titanic data Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 (see Section 4.1.3 and passenger johny_d (see Section 4.1.5) as the instance of interest in the Titanic data. [TOMASZ; JOHNY_D FROM BELFAST IN SECTION 4.1.5.] The average of model predictions for all passengers is equal to \\(v_0 = 0.2356585\\). Table 9.1 presents the scores \\(|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}|\\) and the expected values \\(E[f(X | X^j = x^j_*)]\\). Note that \\(\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}=E[f(X) | X^j = x^j_*]-v_0\\) and, since for all variables \\(E[f(X) | X^j = x^j_*]&gt;v_0\\), we have got \\(E[f(X | X^j = x^j_*)]=|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}|+v_0\\). Table 9.1: Expected values \\(E[f(X) | X^j = x^j_*]\\) and scores \\(|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}|\\) for the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 for the Titanic data and johny_d. The scores are sorted in the decreasing order. variable \\(j\\) \\(E[f(X) | X^j = x^j_*]\\) \\(|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}|\\) age 0.7407795 0.5051210 class 0.6561034 0.4204449 fare 0.6141968 0.3785383 sibsp 0.4786182 0.2429597 parch 0.4679240 0.2322655 embarked 0.4602620 0.2246035 gender 0.3459458 0.1102873 Based on the ordering defined by the scores \\(|\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}|\\) from Table 9.1, we can compute the variable-importance measures based on the sequential contributions \\(\\Delta^{j|J}\\). The computed values are presented in Table 9.2.

Figure 9.3: (fig:BDjohnyExample) Break-down plot for the titanic_rf_v6 model and johny_d for the Titanic data. 9.4 Pros and cons BD plots offer a model-agnostic approach that can be applied to any predictive model that returns a single number. The approach offers several advantages. The plots are easy to understand. They are compact; results for many variables may be presented in a small space. The approach reduces to an intuitive interpretation for the generalized-linear models. Numerical complexity of the BD algorithm is linear in the number of explanatory variables. BD plots for non-additive models may be misleading, as they show only the additive contributions. An important issue is the choice of the ordering of the explanatory variables that is used in the calculation of the variable-importance measures. Also, for models with a large number of variables, the BD plot may be complex and include many variables with small contributions to the instance prediction. 9.5 Code snippets for R In this section, we present key features of the iBreakDown R package (Gosiewska and Biecek 2019a) which is a part of the DrWhy.AI universe. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on CRAN and GitHub. More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/iBreakDown/. For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf_v6 random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 4.1.3. Recall that it is developed to predict the probability of survival from sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for a single observation: johny_d - an 8-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class. DALEX explainers for the model and the jonhy_d data are retrieved via archivist hooks as listed in Section 4.1.7. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) explain_rf_v6 &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/9b971&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) johny_d &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/e3596&quot;) johny_d 9.5.1 Basic use of the break_down() function The iBreakDown::break_down() function calculates the variable-importance measures for a selected model and the instance of interest. The result of applying the break_down() function is a data frame containg the calculated measures. In the simplest call, the function requires only two arguments: the model explainers and the data frame for the instance of interest. The call below essentailly re-creates the variable-importance values (\\(\\Delta^{j|\\{1,\\ldots,j\\}}\\)) presented in Table 9.2. library(&quot;iBreakDown&quot;) bd_rf &lt;- break_down(explain_rf_v6, johny_d) bd_rf ## contribution ## Random Forest v6: intercept 0.235 ## Random Forest v6: age = 8 0.270 ## Random Forest v6: class = 1st 0.086 ## Random Forest v6: fare = 72 -0.046 ## Random Forest v6: gender = male -0.083 ## Random Forest v6: embarked = Southampton -0.003 ## Random Forest v6: sibsp = 0 -0.006 ## Random Forest v6: parch = 0 -0.030 ## Random Forest v6: prediction 0.422 Applying the generic plot() function to the object resulting from the application of the break_down() function creates a BD plot. In this case, it is the plot from Figure 9.3. . plot(bd_rf) 9.5.2 Advanced use of the break_down() function The function break_down() allows more arguments. The most commonly used are: x - a wrapper over a model created with function DALEX::explain(), new_observation - an observation to be explained is should be a data frame with structure that matches the training data, order - a vector of characters (column names) or integers (column indexes) that specify order of explanatory variables that is used for computing the variable-importance measures. If not specified (default), then a one-step heuristic is used to determine the order, keep_distributions - a logical value; if TRUE, then additional diagnostic information about conditional distributions is stored in the resulting object and can be plotted with the generic plot() function. In what follows we illustrate the use of the arguments. First, we will specify the ordering of the explanatory variables. Toward this end we can use integer indexes or variable names. The latter option is prerferable in most cases because of transparency. Additionally, to reduce clutter in the plot, we set max_features = 3 argument in the plot() function. library(&quot;iBreakDown&quot;) bd_rf_order &lt;- break_down(explain_rf_v6, johny_d, order = c(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;, &quot;parch&quot;, &quot;sibsp&quot;, &quot;embarked&quot;)) plot(bd_rf_order, max_features = 3) We can use thekeep_distributions = TRUE argument to enrich the resulting object with additional information about conditional distributions. Subsequently, we can apply the plot_distributions = TRUE argument in the plot() function to present the distributions as violin plots. Red dots in the plots indicate the average model predictions. Thin black lines between violin plots correspond to predictions for individual observations. They can be used to trace how model predictions change after consecutive conditionings. bd_rf_distr &lt;- break_down(explain_rf_v6, johny_d, order = c(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;fare&quot;, &quot;parch&quot;, &quot;sibsp&quot;, &quot;embarked&quot;), keep_distributions = TRUE) plot(bd_rf_distr, plot_distributions = TRUE) References "],

An important issue is that, for models with interactions, the estimated value of the variable-importance measure depends on the ordering of the explanatory varaibles that is used when computing the measure. In this chapter, we present an algorithm that addresses the issue. In particular, the algorithm identifies interactions between pairs of variables and takes them into account when constructing Break-down (BD) plots. In our presentation we focus on interactions that involve pairs of explanatory variables, but the algorithm can be easily extended to interactions involving a larger number of variables. 10.1 Intuition An interation means that the effect of an explanatory variable depends on the value(s) of other variable(s). To illustrate such a situation, we will consider the Titanic dataset (see Section 4.1. For the sake of simplicity, we consider only two variables, age and class. In the data age is a continuous variable, but we will use a dichotomized version of it, with two levels: boys (0-16 years old) and adults (17+ years old). Also, we will consider just two classess: the 2nd and “other”. Table 10.1 shows percentages of survivors for boys and adult men in the 2nd class and other classes on Titanic. Overall, the proportion of surviors among males is 20.5%. However, among boys in the 2nd class, the proportion is 91.7%. How do age and class contribute to this higher survival probability? Let us consider the following two decompositions. The overall probability of survival for males is 20.5%, but for the male passengers from the 2nd class the probability is even lower, i.e. 13.5%. Thus, the effect of the 2nd class is negative, as it decreases the probability of survival by 7%. Now, if, for male passengers of the 2nd class, we consider age, we see that the survival probability for boys increases by 78.2%, from 13.5% (for a male in the 2nd class) to 91.7%. Thus, by considering first the effect of the class, and then the effect of age, we can conclude the effect of -7% for the 2nd class and +78.2% for age (being a boy). The overall probability of survival for males is 20.5%, but for boys the probability is higher, i.e., 40.7%. Thus, the effect of age (being a boy) is positive, as it increases the survival probability by 20.2%. On the other hand, for boys, travelling in the 2nd class increases the probability further, from 40.7% overall to 91.7%. Thus, by considering first the effect of age, and then the effect of class, we can conclude the effect of +20.2% for age (being a boy) and +51% for the 2nd class. By considering effects of class and age in different order, we get very different contributions. This is because there is an interaction: the effect of class depends on the age and vice versa. In particular, from Table 10.1 we could conclude that the overall effect of 2nd class is negative (-7%), as it decreases the probability of survival from 20.5% to 13.5%. On the other hand, the overall effect of age (being a boy) is positive (+20.2%), as it increases the probability of survival from 20.5% to 40.7%. Based on those effects, we would expect a probability of 20.5%-7%+20.2%=33.7% for a boy in the 2nd class. However, the actually observed proportion is much higher, 90.7%. The difference of 90.7%-33.7%=57% is the interaction effect. We can intepret it as an additional effect of the 2nd class specific for boys, or as an additional effect of age (being a boy) for the 2nd class male passengers. Table 10.1: Proportions of survivors for men on Titanic. Class Boys (0-16) Adults (&gt;16) Total 2nd 11/12 = 91.7% 13/166 = 7.8% 24/178 = 13.5% other 22/69 = 31.9% 306/1469 = 20.8% 328/1538 = 21.3% Total 33/81 = 40.7% 319/1635 = 19.5% 352/1716 = 20.5% The example illustrates that interactions complicate the evaluation of the importance of explanatory variables to model predictions. In what follows we present a simple alogrithm to include interactions in the BD plots. 10.2 Method Identification of interactions in the model is performed in three steps (Gosiewska and Biecek 2019a): Calculate the variable-importance measure separately for each explanatory variable. In particular, for each variable, compute \\(\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(x_*)\\) (see Section 9.2). Calculate the measure for each pair of variables. Subtract the obtained value from the sum of the measures for the particular variables to obtain a contribution attributable to an interaction. In particular, for each pair of variables, compute \\(\\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}|\\emptyset}\\) (see Section 9.2) and then \\(\\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}}_I(x_*) \\equiv \\Delta^{\\{i,j\\}|\\emptyset}(x_*)-\\Delta^{i|\\emptyset}(x_*)-\\Delta^{j|\\emptyset}(x_*)\\). Rank the so-obtained importance measures for the ``main’’ and interaction effects to determine the final ordering for computing the variable-importance measures. Using the ordering, compute variable-importance measures \\(v(j, x_*) = \\Delta^{j|\\{1, ..., j-1\\}}(x_*)\\) (see Section 9.2). The numerical complexity of the first step is \\(O(p)\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of explanatory variables. For the second step, the complexity is \\(O(p^2)\\), while for the third step it is \\(O(p)\\). Thus, the complexity of the entire procedure is \\(O(p^2)\\). 10.3 Example: Titanic data Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 (see Section 4.1.3 and passenger johny_d (see Section 4.1.5) as the instance of interest in the Titanic data.

However, in case of interactions, the iBD plots provide more correct explanations. Though the numerical complexity of the iBD procedure is quadratic, it may be time-consuming in case of models with a large number of explanaotry variables. For such models, the results may be sensitive to noise, because the number of pairs grows faster than the number of variables. [TOMASZ: “NOISE” IN WHICH SENSE?]. The identification of interactions in the presented procedure is not based on a formal statistical significance test. Thus, for small sample sizes, the procedure may be prone to errors. 10.5 Code snippets for R For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf_v6 random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 4.1.3. Recall that it is developed to predict the probability of survival from sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for a single observation: johny_d - an 8-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class. DALEX explainers for the model and the jonhy_d data are retrieved via archivist hooks as listed in Section 4.1.7. library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) explain_rf_v6 &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/9b971&quot;) library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) johny_d &lt;- archivist::aread(&quot;pbiecek/models/e3596&quot;) johny_d The key function to construct iBD plots is the iBreakDown::break_down() function from the iBreakDown R package (Gosiewska and Biecek 2019a).

We also indicated that, in the presence of interactions, the computed value of the contribution depends on the order of explanatory covariates that is used in calculations. One solution to the problem is to find an ordering in which the most important variables are placed at the beginning. Another solution, described in Chapter 10, is to identify interactions and explicitly present their contributions to the predictions. In this chapter, we introduce yet another approach to address the ordering issue. It is based on the idea of averaging the value of a variable’s contribution over all, or a large number of, possible orderings. The idea is closely linked to ‘’Shapley values’’ (Shapley 1953), developed originally for cooperative games. The approach was first introduced in (Strumbelj and Kononenko 2010) and (Štrumbelj and Kononenko 2014). It was widely adopted after the publication of the 2017 paper (Lundberg and Lee 2017) and Python’s library SHAP (Lundberg 2019). The authors of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) introduced an efficient algorithm for tree-based models (Lundberg, Erion, and Lee 2018). They also showed that Shapley values were an unification of a collection of different commonly used techniques for model explanations. 11.1 Intuition Figure 11.1 presents BD plots for ten random orderings (indicated by the order of the rows in each plot) of explanatory variables for the prediction for johny_d (see Section 4.1.5) for the random-forest model (see Section 4.1.3 for the Titanic dataset.[TOMASZ: CORRECT?] The plots show clear differences in the contributions of various variables for different orderings. The most remarkable differences can be observed for variables fare and class, with contributions changing the sign depending on the ordering. Figure 11.1: (fig:shap10orderings) Break-down plots for ten random orderings of explanatory variables for the prediction for johny_d for the random-forest model for the Titanic dataset. Each panel presents a single ordering, indicated by the order of the rows in the plot To remove the influence of the ordring of the variables, we can compute an average value of the contributions. Figure 11.2 presents the average contributions, calculated over the ten orderings presented in Figure 11.1. Red and green bars present, respectively, the negative and positive averages. Violet box-plots summarize the distribution of the contributions for each explanatory variable. [TOMASZ: WHAT IS THE CHOICE FOR ORDERING THE ROWS? DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE AVERAGE.]The plot indicates that the most important variables, from the point of view of the prediction for johny_d, are age and gender. Figure 11.2: (fig:shapOrdering) Average contributions for ten random orderings. Red and green bars present the averages. Box-plots summarize the distribution of contributions for each explanatory variable across the orderings. 11.2 Method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are based on ‘’Shapley values,’’ a concept in cooperative game theory developed by Lloyd Shapley (Shapley 1953). [TOMASZ: SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT “SHAP”, “SHAP VALUES”, OR “SHAPLEY VALUES”?] Consider the following problem. A coalition of players cooperates, and obtains a certain overall gain from the cooperation. Players are not identical, and different players may have different importance. Cooperation is beneficial, because it may bring more benefit than individual actions. The problem to solve is how to distribute the generated surplus among the players? The Shapley value provides one possible fair answer to this question (Shapley 1953). Now let’s translate this problem to the context of model predictions. Explanatory variables are the players, while model \\(f()\\) plays the role of the coalition. The payoff from the coalition is the model prediction. The problem to solve is how to distribute the model prediction across particular variables? The idea of using Shapley values for evaluation of local variable-importance was introduced in (Strumbelj and Kononenko 2010). We define them here in the notation introduced in Section 9.2. Let us consider a permutation \\(J\\) of the set of indices \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,p\\}\\) corresponding to an ordering of \\(p\\) explanatory variables included in model \\(f()\\). Denote by \\(\\pi(J,j)\\) the set of the indices of the variables that are positioned in \\(J\\) before the \\(j\\)-th variable. Note that, if the \\(j\\)-th variable is placed as the first, then \\(\\pi(J,j) = \\emptyset\\). Consider the model prediction \\(f(x_*)\\) for a particular instance of interest \\(x_*\\). The Shapley value [TOMASZ: OR SHAP?] is defined as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\varphi(x_*,j) = \\frac{1}{p!} \\sum_{J} \\Delta^{j|\\pi(J,j)}(x_*), \\tag{11.1} \\end{equation}\\] where the sum is taken over all \\(p!\\) possible permutations (orderings of explanatory variables) and the variable-importance measure \\(\\Delta^{j|J}(x_*)\\) was defined in Section 9.2. Essentially, \\(\\varphi(x_*,j)\\) is the average of the variable-importance measures across all possible orderings of explanatory variables. It is worth noting that the value of \\(\\Delta^{j|\\pi(J,j)}(x_*)\\) is constant for all ordering \\(J\\) that share with the same subset \\(\\pi(J,j)\\). It follows that equation (11.1) can be expressed in an alternative form: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\varphi(x_*,j) &amp;=&amp; \\frac 1{p!}\\sum_{s=0}^{p-1} \\sum_{ \\substack{ S \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,p\\}\\setminus \\{j\\} \\\\ |S|=s }} \\left[s!(p-1-s)! \\Delta^{j|S}(x_*)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac 1{p}\\sum_{s=0}^{p-1} \\sum_{ \\substack{ S \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,p\\}\\setminus \\{j\\} \\\\ |S|=s }} \\left[{{p-1}\\choose{s}}^{-1} \\Delta^{j|S}(x_*)\\right], \\tag{11.2} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(|S|\\) denotes the cardinal number (size) of set \\(S\\) and the second sum is taken over all subsets \\(S\\) of explanatory variables, excluding the \\(j\\)-th one, of size \\(s\\). Note that the number of all subsets of sizes from 0 to \\(p-1\\) is \\(2^{p-1}\\), i.e., it is much smaller than number of all permutations \\(p!\\). Nevertheless, for a large \\(p\\), it may not be feasible to compute the Shapley value from (11.1) nor (11.2). In that case, an estimate based on a sample of permutations may be considered. A Monte Carlo estimator was introduced in (Štrumbelj and Kononenko 2014). An efficient implementation of computations of Shapley values was introduced in (Lundberg and Lee 2017). From the properties of Shapley values for cooperative games it follows that, in the context of predictive models, they enjoy the following properties: Symmetry: if two explanatory variables \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) are interchangeable, i.e., for any set of explanatory variables \\(S \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,p\\}\\setminus \\{j,k\\}\\) we have got \\[ \\Delta^{j|S}(x_*) = \\Delta^{k|S}(x_*), \\] then their Shapley values are equal: \\[ \\varphi(x_*,j) = \\varphi(x_*,k). \\] Dummy feature: if an explanatory variable \\(j\\) does not contribute to any prediction for any set of explanatory variables \\(S \\subseteq \\{1,\\dots,p\\}\\setminus \\{j\\}\\), that is, \\[ \\Delta^{j|S}(x_*) = 0, \\] then its Shapley value is equal to 0: \\[ \\varphi(x_*,j) = 0. \\] Additivity: if model \\(f()\\) is a sum of two other models \\(g()\\) and \\(h()\\), then the Shapley value calculated for model \\(f()\\) is a sum of Shapley values for models \\(g()\\) and \\(h()\\). Local accuracy: the sum of Shapley values is equal to the model predicition, that is, \\[ f(x_*) - E_X[f(X)] = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\varphi(x_*,j). \\] ## Preparation of a new explainer is initiated ## -&gt; model label : Random Forest v6 ## -&gt; data : 2207 rows 7 cols ## -&gt; target variable : 2207 values ## -&gt; predict function : yhat.randomForest will be used ([33mdefault[39m) ## -&gt; predicted values : numerical, min = 0 , mean = 0.2353095 , max = 1 ## -&gt; residual function : difference between y and yhat ([33mdefault[39m) ## -&gt; residuals : numerical, min = -0.892 , mean = 0.0868473 , max = 1 ## [32mA new explainer has been created![39m 11.3 Example: Titanic data Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 (see Section 4.1.3 and passenger johny_d (see Section 4.1.5) as the instance of interest in the Titanic data. Box-plots in Figure 11.3 present the distribution of the contributions \\(\\Delta^{j|\\pi(J,j)}(x_*)\\) for each explanatory variable of the model for 25 random orderings of the explanatory variables. Red and green bars represent, respectively, the negative and positive Shapley values across the orderings. It is clear that the young age of Johny D results in a positive contribution for all orderings. The Shapley value is equal to \\(0.2525\\). On the other hand, the effect of gender is in all cases negative, with the Shapley value equal to \\(-0.0908\\). The picture for fare and class is more complex, as their contributions can even change the sign, depending on the ordering. While Figure 11.3 presents the Shapley values separately for each of the variables, it is worth noting that, by using the iBD plot in Section 10.3 the pair was identified as one for each an interaction effect was present. Hence, the effect of the variables should not be separated. [TOMASZ: SO? WHAT TO DO IN THIS CASE? FORGET ABOUT THE AVERAGES?] Figure 11.3: (fig:shappJohny02) Variable contributions for the prediction for johny_d for the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 and the Titanic data for 25 random orderings. Box-plots summarize the distribution of the contributions for each explanatory variable across the orderings. Red and green bars present the Shapley values. In most applications the detailed information about the distribution of variable contributions across the considered orderings of explanatory variabled will not be necessary. Thus, one could simplify the plot by presenting only the Shapley values, as in Figure 11.4. Figure 11.4: (fig:shappJohny01) Shapley values for the prediction for johny_d for the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 and the Titanic data for 25 random orderings. Table 11.1 presents the Shapley values underlying the plot in Figure 11.4. Table: (#tab:shapOrderingTable) Shapley values for the prediction for johny_d for the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 and the Titanic data for 25 random orderings.

In (Lundberg and Lee 2017) it is shown that the method unifies different approaches to additive features attribution, like DeepLIFT [TOMASZ: REFERENCE?], Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation [TOMASZ: REFERENCE?], or LIME [TOMASZ: REFERENCE?]. The method has got a strong formal foundation derived from the cooperative games theory. It also enjoys an efficient implementation in Python, with ports or re-implementations in R. An important drawback of the Shapley values is that they are based on the assumption of additivity of variable effects. If the model is not additive, then the Shapley values may be misleading. This issue can be seen as arising from the fact that, in the cooperative games, the goal is to distribute the payoff among payers. However, in the predictive modelling context, we want to understand how do the players affect the payoff? Thus, we are not limited to independent payoff-splits for players. It is worth noting that, for an additive model, the approaches presented in Chapters 9, 10, and in the current one lead to same variable contributions. [TOMASZ: THIS IS CONFUSING. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? FOR BD PLOTS, IT WAS ARGUED THAT THE COMPUTED VALUES DEPEND ON THE ORDERING. SHAPLEY VALUES DO NOT, SO HOW CAN THEY LEAD TO THE SAME RESULTS? OR, DOES THE TERM “CONTRIBUTION” MEAN SOMETHING ELSE? IF SO, WE HAVE GOT TO BE PRECISE.] An important practical limitation of the method is that, for large models, the calculation of the Shapley values is time consuming. However, sub-sampling can be used to address the issue. 11.5 Code snippets for R In this section, we present the key features of the iBreakDown R package (Gosiewska and Biecek 2019a) which is a part of the DrWhy.AI universe. The package covers all methods presented in this chapter. It is available on CRAN and GitHub. More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/iBreakDown/. Note that there are also other R packages that offer similar functionality, like shapper (Gosiewska and Biecek 2019b), which is a wrapper for the Python library SHAP (Lundberg 2019), and iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018a). For illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf_v6 random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 4.1.3. Recall that it is developed to predict the probability of survival from sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for a single observation: johny_d - an 8-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class.

The function is applied to the explainer, created with the explain() function from the DALEX package, and a data frame for the instance of interest. Additionally, in the B=25 argument we indicate that we want to select 25 random orderings of explanatory variables for whcih the Shapley values are to be computed. The resulting object is a data frame with variable contributions computed for every ordering. Applying the generic function plot() to the object conctructs the plot that includes the Shapley values and the corresponding box-plots. library(&quot;iBreakDown&quot;) shap_johny &lt;- shap(explain_rf_v6, johny_d, B = 25) plot(shap_johny) To obtain a plot with only Shapley values, as in Figure 11.3, we can use the show_boxplots=FALSE argument in the plot() function call. plot(shap_johny, show_boxplots = FALSE) The object obtained as a result of the application of function shap() allows to compute other summary statistics beyond the average. shap_johny ## min q1 ## Random Forest v6: age = 8 0.10506208 0.269811509 ## Random Forest v6: class = 1st -0.15308473 -0.055009515 ## Random Forest v6: embarked = Southampton -0.01956865 -0.010705936 ## Random Forest v6: fare = 72 -0.09093974 -0.064902583 ## Random Forest v6: gender = male -0.16633711 -0.130869053 ## Random Forest v6: parch = 0 -0.03282102 -0.022334391 ## Random Forest v6: sibsp = 0 -0.01183054 -0.005636837 ## median mean ## Random Forest v6: age = 8 0.277260082 0.270030449 ## Random Forest v6: class = 1st 0.040353421 0.021730240 ## Random Forest v6: embarked = Southampton -0.008434146 -0.007744594 ## Random Forest v6: fare = 72 -0.024640689 0.028716774 ## Random Forest v6: gender = male -0.111716792 -0.114865392 ## Random Forest v6: parch = 0 -0.010652469 -0.013505029 ## Random Forest v6: sibsp = 0 0.006377889 0.002328083 ## q3 max ## Random Forest v6: age = 8 0.290095152 0.37092796 ## Random Forest v6: class = 1st 0.075445628 0.18560671 ## Random Forest v6: embarked = Southampton -0.006456729 0.01118532 ## Random Forest v6: fare = 72 0.143228817 0.18506117 ## Random Forest v6: gender = male -0.098434073 -0.04588038 ## Random Forest v6: parch = 0 -0.003043951 0.00165836 ## Random Forest v6: sibsp = 0 0.007650204 0.01422474 [TOMASZ: THE CODE BELOW DOES NOT WORK: ERROR MESSAGE REGARDING UNAVAILABILITY OF A ‘CLI’ PACKAGE.] # library(“dplyr”) # shap_johny %&gt;% # group_by(variable) %&gt;% # summarise(avg = mean(contribution), # q10 = quantile(contribution, 0.1), # q90 = quantile(contribution, 0.9)) %&gt;% # arrange(-abs(avg)) References "],

In case of such models it makes sense to explore each variable separately and analyze how does it affect model predictions. Break-down (BD) plots and plots of Shapley values, introduced in Chapters 9 and 11, respectively, are most suitable for modela with a small or moderate number of explanator variables. These plots do not offer as detailed information as the CP profiles, but can include more variables. None of those approaches is well-suited for models with a large number of explanatory variables. Such models with even thousands of variables are not uncommon in, for instance, genomics. Also, if most of explanatory variables are binary, then CP profiles and BD plots are not very infromative. In such cases, sparse explainers offer a useful alternative. The most popular example of such explainers are Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and their modifications. The LIME method was originally proposed in (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016). The key idea behind this method is to locally approximate a black-box model by a simpler white-box model, which is easier to interpret. In this chapter, we describe the approach. 12.2 Intuition The intuition behind LIME is explained in Figure 12.1. We want to understand the predictions of a complex black-box model around a single instance of interest. The model presented in Figure 12.1 is a binary classifier, i.e., it pertains to a binary dependent variable. The axes represent the values of two continuous explanatory variables. The colored areas correspond to the decision regions, i.e., they indicate for which combinations of the variables the model classifies the observation to one of the two classes. The instance of interest is marked with the large black dot. By using an artificial dataset around the instance of interest, we can use a simpler white-box model that will locally approximate the predictions of the black-box model. The white-box model may then serve as a ‘’local explainer’’ for the more complex model. We may select different classes of white-box models. The most typical choices are regularized linear models like LASSO regression or decision trees [TOMASZ: ADD REFERENCES]. The important point is to limit the complexity of the models, so that they are easier to explain. Figure 12.1: (fig:limeEx) The idea behind local model approximations. The axes represent the values of two continuous explanatory variables in a binary-classification mode. The colored areas for which combinations of the variables the model classifies the observation to one of the two classes. To ‘’explain’’ the prediction for the instance of interest (the large black dot), an artificial dataset around it is used to construct a simpler white-box model (here, a logistic-regression model, indicated by the dashed line) that locally approximates the predictions of the black-box model. 12.3 Method We want to find a model that locally approximates a black-box model \\(f()\\) around the instance of interest \\(x_*\\). Consider class \\(G\\) of interpretable models. To find the required approximation, We can can consider the following ‘’loss function,’’ \\[ L(f, g, \\Pi_{x_*}) + \\Omega (g), \\] where model \\(g()\\) belongs to class \\(G\\), \\(\\Pi_{x_*}\\) of \\(x^*\\) defines a neighborhood of \\(x_*\\) in which approximation is sought, \\(L()\\) is a goodness-of-fit measure (e.g., the likelihood), and \\(\\Omega(g)\\) is a penalty for the complexity of model \\(g()\\). The penalty is used to select simple models from class \\(G\\). Note that the models \\(f()\\) and \\(g()\\) may apply to different data spaces. The black-box model (function) \\(f(x):\\mathcal X \\rightarrow \\mathcal R\\) is defined on the original, lare-dimensional space \\(\\mathcal X\\). The white-box model (function) \\(g:\\mathcal X&#39; \\rightarrow \\mathcal R\\) applies to a lower-dmension, more interpretable space \\(\\mathcal X&#39;\\). We will present some examples of \\(\\mathcal X&#39;\\) in the next section. For now we will just assume that function \\(h()\\) transforms \\(\\mathcal X\\) into \\(\\mathcal X&#39;\\). If we limit class \\(G\\) to sparse linear models, the following algorithm may be used to find an interpretable white-box model \\(g()\\) that includes \\(K\\) most important, interpretable explanatory variables: Input: N - sample size for the white-box model [TOMASZ: CHANGED. CORRECT?] Input: K - number of variables for the white-box model [TOMASZ: CHANGED. CORRECT?] 1. Let x&#39; = h(x) be an interpretable version of x [TOMASZ: WHAT IS x?] 2. for i in 1...N { 3. z&#39;[i] &lt;- sample_around(x&#39;) 4. y&#39;[i] &lt;- f(z[i]) # prediction for a new observation [TOMASZ: WHAT IS z[i]?] 5. w&#39;[i] &lt;- similarity(x, z[i]) [TOMASZ: WHAT IS SIMILARITY? z[i]?] 6. } 7. return K-LASSO(y&#39;, x&#39;, w&#39;) In Step 7, \\(K-LASSO(y&#39;, x&#39;, w&#39;)\\) stands for a weighted LASSO linear-regression that selects \\(K\\) most important variables based on new dataset \\((y&#39;, x&#39;)\\) with weights \\(w&#39;\\). The practical implementation of the idea involves three important steps, which are discussed in the subsequent sub-sections. 12.3.1 Interpretable data representation As it has been mentioned, the black-box model \\(f()\\) and the white-box model \\(g()\\) may apply to different data spaces. For example, let’s consider a VGG16 neural network applied to ImageNet data. [TOMASZ: IS IT A WELL-KNOWN EXAMPLE? ANY REFERENCE?] The model uses an image of the size of \\(244 \\times 244\\) pixels as input and predicts to which of 1000 potential categories does the image belong to. The original data space is of dimension \\(3 \\times 244 \\times 244\\), i.e., it is 178,608-dimensional with three single-color channels (red, green, blue) for a single pixel. Explaining predictions in such a high-dimensional space is difficult. Instead, the space can be transformed into superpixels, which are treated as binary features that can be turned on or off. Figure 12.2 presents an example of 100 superpixels created for an ambiguous picture. Thus, in this case the black-box model \\(f()\\) operates in principle on data space \\(\\mathcal X=R^{178608}\\) [TOMASZ: NOT SURE ABOUT THAT, COLOR COORDINATES ARE PROBABLY 256 VALUES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.], while the white-box model \\(g()\\) works on space \\(\\mathcal X&#39; = \\{0,1\\}^{100}\\). It is worth noting that superpixels are frequent choices for image data. For text data, words are frequently used as interpretable variables. To reduce to complexity of the data space, continuous variables are often discretized to obtain interpretable tabular data. In case of categorical variables, combination of categires is often used. Figure 12.2: (fig:duckHorse06) The left panel shows an ambiguous picture, half-horse and half-duck. The right panel shows 100 superpixels identified for this figure. [TOMASZ: SOURCE OF THE IMAGE?] 12.3.2 Sampling around the instance of interest To develop the locally-approximation white-box model, new data points around the instance of interest are needed. It may not be enough to sample points from the original dataset, because in a high-dimensional data space the data are usually very sparse and data points are ‘’far’’ from each other. For this reason, the data for the development of the white-box model are often created by using perturbations of the instance of interest. For a set of binary variables, the common choice is to change (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) the value of a randomly-selected number of variables describing the instance of interest. For continuous variables, various proposals are introduced in different papers. [TOMASZ: WE SHOULD PROVIDE OME CONCRETE IDEAS WITH REFERENCES.] In the example of the duck-horse in Figure 12.2, the perturbations of the image would be created by randomly including or excluding some of the superpixels. 12.3.3 Developing the white-box model Once the new data were sampled around the instance of interest, we may attempt to develop an interpretable white-box model \\(g()\\) from class \\(G\\). The most common choices for \\(G\\) are generalized linear models. To get sparse models, i.e., models with a limited number of variables, LASSO or similar regularization-modelling techniques are used. For instance, in the algorithm presented in Section 12.3, the \\(K-LASSO\\) method has been mentioned. An alternative choice are classification-and-regression trees. Figure 12.3 presents LIME for the top two classes [TOMASZ: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?] selected by the neural network VGG16. The explanations were obtained with the \\(K-LASSO\\) method which selected \\(K\\) [TOMASZ: WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF K?] superpixels that were the most influential from the model-prediction point of view. For each of the two classes, the top \\(K\\) [TOMASZ: WHAT WAS THE VALUE OF K?] superpixels are highlighted. It is interesting to observe that the superpixel which contains the beak is influential for the prediction ‘’goose,’’ while the superpixels linked with the colour are influential for the prediction ‘’standard poodle’’. Figure 12.3: (fig:duckHorse04) LIME for two predictions (‘’standard poodle’’ and ‘’goose’’) obtained by the VGG16 network with ImageNet weights for the half-duck, half-horse image. [TOMASZ: SOURCE OF THE IMAGE?] 12.4 Example: Titanic data Let us consider the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 (see Section 4.1.3 and passenger johny_d (see Section 4.1.5) as the instance of interest in the Titanic data. Figure 12.4 presents explanations generated by the LIME method.[TOMASZ: WHAT ARE THOSE NUMBERS? WHAT WAS THE SIMPLIFIED MODEL? LOGISITIC REGRESSION? ANY PENALTY FOR COMPLEXITY?] Three variables are identified as the most influential: age, gender, and class. Note that, for age, a dichotomized version of the orignially conitinuous variable is used. On the other hand, for class, a dichotomized version based on the combination of several original categories is used. Figure 12.4: (fig:LIMEexample01) LIME method for the prediction for johny_d for the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 and the Titanic data. [TOMASZ: WHAT ARE THOSE NUMBERS?] Figure 12.5 illustrates how the two levels for age can be extracted from the CP. [TOMASZ: HOW ARE THE TWO LEVELS OBTAINED?] Figure 12.5: (fig:LIMEexample02) Interpretable variable generated for age. LIME method for the prediction for johny_d for the random-forest model titanic_rf_v6 and the Titanic data. 12.5 Pros and cons As mentioned by (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016), the LIME method - is model-agnostic, as it does not imply any assumptions on the black-box model structure, - offers an interpretable representation, because the original data space is transformed into a more interpretable lower-dimension space (like tranformation from individual pixels to super pixels for image data), - provides local fidelity, i.e., the explanations are locally well-fitted to the black-box model. The method has been widely adopted in text and image analysis, in part due to the interpretable data representation. The underlying intuition for the method is easy to understand: a simpler model is used to approximate a more complex one. By using a simpler model, with a smaller number of interpretable explanatory variabes, predictions are easier to explain. The LIME method can be applied to complex, high-dimensional models. There are several important limitations. For instance, despite several proposals, the issue of finding interpretable representations for continuous and categorical variables is not solved yet. Also, because the white-box model is selected to approximate the black-box model, and the data themselves, the method does not control the quality of the local fit of the white-box model to the data. Thus, the latter model may be misleading. Finally, in high-dimensional data, data points are sparse. Defining a ‘’local neighborhood’’ of the instance of interest may not be straghtforward. 12.6 Code snippets for R LIME and similar methods are implemented in various R and Python packages. For example, lime (Pedersen and Benesty 2018) is a port of the LIME Python library (Lundberg 2019), while live (Staniak and Biecek 2018), localModel (Staniak and Biecek 2019), and iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018a) are separate R packages. Different implementations of LIME offer different algorithms for extraction of interpretable features, different methods for sampling, and different methods of weighting. For instance, regarding transformation of continuous variables into interpretable features, lime performs global discretization using quartiles, localModel performs local discretization using CP profiles, while live and iml work directly on continuous variables. Due to these differences, the packages yield different results (explanations). In what follows, for illustration purposes, we use the titanic_rf_v6 random-forest model for the Titanic data developed in Section 4.1.3. Recall that it is developed to predict the probability of survival from sinking of Titanic. Instance-level explanations are calculated for a single observation: johny_d - an 8-year-old passenger that travelled in the 1st class.

In this section we will compare these approaches. Discuss their strengths and weaknesses taking into account different possible applications. 13.1 Number of variables, size of the model input One of the most importance criteria for selection of model explainer is the size of important variables in the model. figure/instanceExplainer.jpg 13.1.1 Low to medium number of variables Small number of features usually means that particular features are interpretable. In cases in which only few variables influence the model output the most detailed information about the model is presented by Ceteris Paribus profiles. In such cases the most common approach to model exploration is to validate which variables are most influential when it comes to model response, for example with Variable Oscillations presented in 7 and then present individual variables with individual Ceteris Paribus profiles as presented in 6. Examples for such cases: Predictive model for Titanic data, each feature is interpretable, there is less than dozen features. 13.1.2 Medium to large number of variables When the number of variables in model input increase it is harder to show each profile for each individual variable. In most cases medium number of features means that features are still interpretable. In such cases the most common approach would be to use Break Down (presented in 9) or Shapley values (presented in 11). We can still read if particular feature has positive or negative effect, we can judge the size of the effect. If necessary we can limit the plot only to the most important features. Examples for such cases: Credit scoring model based on behavioral data, created on 100+ variables. Features are interpretable, but it makes no sense to plot all 100 ceteris paribus plots. 13.1.3 Large to very large number of variables When input space is very large, in many cases single input has no interpretation, thus it makes no sense to consider inputs independently. Think about individual pixels in image processing, or individual characters in text analysis. Both, due to the lack of interpretability of a single variables as well as due to problems with computational complexity, it is not feasible to plot Ceteris Profiles, or Break Down Profiles not calculate Shapley values. The most common approach is to use LIME method (presented in 12) that works on context relevant groups of features (aka aspects). Examples for such cases: Image classification with images as single features. 13.2 Independent / correlated variables In most methods we assumed that variables are independent. But it in many datasets we have some correlated variables. Think about examples like number of rooms and surface of an apartment (the larger apartment the larger number of rooms and larger surface). For such cases it may have no sense to consider instances with low probability of occurrence, like very large number of rooms for very little apartments. For this reason techniques that rely on independent permutations or conditioning will lead to biased results. Two most common approaches in such cases are create new features that are independent (sometimes it’s possible due to domain knowledge, sometimes PCA or similar techniques may be useful), permute features in blocks in order to keep correlation structures, as it is described in the 12 chapter. 13.3 Additive / non additive models In non additive models effect of one variable may depend on values of other variables. For example probability of survival on Titanic may decrease with age but the effect may be different for different classes of passengers. So effect of one variable is modulated by another variable. This means that to understand non-additive models we need to consider not only features independently but also in sets of potential interactions. For pairwise interactions one can plot 2-dimensional Ceteris Paribus profiles calculated in the same way as introduced in 6. In order to identify interactions in model response one can use Break Down plots with interactions as introduces in 10. 13.4 Sparse / non sparse explanations Predictive models may use hundreds variables to construct response for an individual instance. Number of variables does not mater since these are just functions and may operate on input of any size. But humans cannot easily keep too large context in mind. Few variables at max. Easy to understand explanations need to be sparse. It’s kind of tricky problem, looking for sparse explanations for non sparse models. It is easy to trick yourself. One can use Variable Oscillations (presented in 7) or Break Down (presented in 9) or Shapley values (presented in 11) to better understand how many features affect model response. The most common method that produce sparse explanations is LIME (presented in 12). But be careful to use this method for non sparse models. 13.5 When to use? In previous chapters we show how to use model explainers for exploration, explanation and debugging of predictive models. But number of possible use cases is much larger. Think about following. Model improvement. If model works particular bad for a selected observation (the residual is very high) then investigation of model responses for miss fitted points may give some hints how to improve the model. For individual predictions it is easier to notice that selected variable should have different a effect. Additional domain specific validation. Understanding which factors are important for model predictions helps to be critical about model response. If model contributions are against domain knowledge then we may be more skeptical and willing to try another model. On the other hand, if the model response is aligned with domain knowledge we may trust more in these responses. Such trust is important in decisions that may lead to serious consequences like predictive models in medicine. Model selection. Having multiple candidate models one may select the final response based on model explanations. Even if one model is better in terms of global model performance it may happen that locally other model is better fitted. This moves us towards model consultations that identify different options and allow human to select one of them. "],

This is the main difference from the instance level explainers that were focused on a model behaviour around a single observation. Model level explainers work in the context of a population or subpopulation. Think about following use-cases One wants to know which variables are important in the model. Think about model for heart accident in which features come from additional medical examinations. Knowing which examinations are not important one can reduce a model by removing unnecessary variables. One wants to understand how a selected variable affects the model response. Think about a model for prediction of apartment prices. You know that apartment location is an important factor, but which locations are better and how much a given location is worth? Model explainers help to understand how values of a selected variable affect the model response. One wants to know if there are any unusual observations that do not fit to the model. Observations with unusually large residuals. Think about a model for survival after some very risky treatment. You would like to know if for some patients the model predictions are extremely incorrect. All cases mentioned above are linked with either model diagnostic (checking if model behaves alog our expectations) or knowledge extraction (model was trained to extract some knowledge about the discipline). 14.1 Approaches to model explanations Model level explanations are focused on four main aspects of a model. Model performance. Here the question is how good is the model, is it good enough (better than some predefined threshold), is a model A better than model B? Variable importance. How important are variables, which are the most important and which are not important at all? Variable effects. What is the relation between a variable and model response, can the variable be transformed to create a better model? Model residuals. Is there any unusual pattern related to residuals, are they biased, are they correlated with some additional variable? 14.2 A bit of philosophy: Three Laws for Model Level Explanations In the spirit of three laws introduces in the chapter 1.3 here we propose three laws for model level explanations. Variable importance. For every model we shall be able to understand which variables are important and which are not. Model audit. For every model we shall be able to verify basic check like if residuals are correlated with variables and if there are unusual observations. Second opinion. For every model we shall be able to compare it against other models to verify if they capture different stories about the data. "],
["featureImportance.html", "Chapter 15 Feature Importance 15.1 Permutation Based Feature Importance 15.2 Example: Titanic 15.3 Example: Price prediction 15.4 More models 15.5 Level frequency", " Chapter 15 Feature Importance Methods presented in this chapter are useful for assessment of feature importance. There are many possible applications of such methods, for example: Feature importance scores may be used for feature filtering. Features that are not important may be removed from the model training procedure. Removal of the noise shall lead to better models. Identification of the most important features may be used as a validation of a model against domain knowledge. Just to make sure that it’s not like a single random feature dominates model predictions. Identification of the most important features may leads to new domain knowledge. Well, we have identified important features. Comparison of feature importance between different models helps to understand how different models handle particular features. Ranking of feature importance helps to decide in what order we shall perform further model exploration, in what order we shall examine particular feature effects. There are many methods for assessment of feature importance. In general we may divide them into two groups, methods that are model specific and methods that are model agnostic. Some models like random forest, gradient boosting, linear models and many others have their own ways to assess feature importance. Such method are linked with the particular structure of the model. In terms of linear models such specific measures are linked with normalized regression coefficients of p-values. For tree based ensembles such measures may be based on utilization of particular features in particular trees, see (Foster 2017) for gradient boosting or (Paluszynska and Biecek 2017a) for random forest. But in this book we are focused on methods that are model agnostic. The may reason for that is First, be able to apply this method to any predictive model or ensemble of models. Second, (which is maybe even more important) to be able to compare feature importance between models despite differences in their structure. Model agnostic methods cannot assume anything about the model structure and we do not want to refit a model. The method that is presented below is described in details in the (Fisher, Rudin, and Dominici 2018). The main idea is to measure how much the model fit will decrease if a selected feature or group of features will be cancelled out. Here cancellation means perturbations like resampling from empirical distribution of just permutation. The method can be used to measure importance of single features, pairs of features or larger tuples For the simplicity below we describe algorithm for single features, but it is straight forward to use it for larger subsets of features. 15.1 Permutation Based Feature Importance The idea behind is easy and in some sense borrowed from Random Forest (Breiman et al. 2018). If a feature is important then after permutation model performance shall drop. The larger drop the more important is the feature. Let’s describe this idea in a bit more formal way. Let \\(\\mathcal L(f(x), y)\\) be a loss function that assess goodness of fit for a model \\(f(x)\\) while let \\(\\mathcal X\\) be a set of features. For each feature \\(x_i \\in \\mathcal X\\) do steps 2-5 Create a new data \\(x^{*,-i}\\) with feature \\(x_i\\) resampled (or permutated). Calculate model predictions for the new data \\(x^{*,-i}\\), they will be denoted as \\(f(x^{*,-i})\\). Calculate loss function for models predictions on perturbed data \\[ L^{*,-i} = \\mathcal L(f(x^{*,-i}), y) \\] Feature importance may be calculated as difference or ratio of the original loss and loss on perturbed data, i.e. \\(vip(x_i) = L^{*,-i} - L\\) or \\(vip(x_i) = L^{*,-i} / L\\). Note that ranking of feature importance will be the same for the difference and the ratio since the loss \\(L\\) is the same. Note also, that the main advantage of the step 5 is that feature importance is kind of normalized. But in many cases such normalization is not needed and in fact it makes more sense to present raw \\(L^{*,-i}\\) values. 15.2 Example: Titanic Let’s use this approach to a random forest model created for the Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict passenger survival probability based on their sex, age, class, fare and some other features available in the titanic dataset. head(titanic) ## gender age class embarked country fare sibsp parch survived ## 1 male 42 3rd Southampton United States 7.11 0 0 no ## 2 male 13 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 0 2 no ## 3 male 16 3rd Southampton United States 20.05 1 1 no ## 4 female 39 3rd Southampton England 20.05 1 1 yes ## 5 female 16 3rd Southampton Norway 7.13 0 0 yes ## 6 male 25 3rd Southampton United States 7.13 0 0 yes ## age_cat fare_cat ## 1 (30,50] (0,10] ## 2 (10,18] (10,25] ## 3 (10,18] (10,25] ## 4 (30,50] (10,25] ## 5 (10,18] (0,10] ## 6 (18,30] (0,10] Permutation based feature importance can be calculated with the feature_importance{ingredients}. By default it permutes values feature by feature. Instead of showing normalized feature importance we plot both original \\(L\\) and loss after permutation \\(L^{*,-i}\\). This way we can read also how good was the model, and as we will see in next subsection it will be useful for model comparison. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) fi_rf &lt;- feature_importance(explain_titanic_rf) plot(fi_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Permutation based feature importance&quot;, &quot;For Random Forest model and Titanic data&quot;) Figure 15.1: Feature importance. Each interval presents the difference between original model performance (left end) and the performance on a dataset with a single feature perturbed It’s interesting that the most important variable for Titanic data is the Sex. So it have been ,,women first’’ after all. Then the three features of similar importance are passenger class (first class has higher survival), age (kids have higher survival) and fare (owners of more pricy tickets have higher survival). Note that drawing permutations evolves some randomness. Thus to have higher repeatability of results you may either set a seed for random number generator or replicate the procedure few times. The second approach has additional advantage, that you will learn the uncertainty behind feature importance assessment. Here we present scores for 10 repetition of the process. fi_rf10 &lt;- replicate(10, feature_importance(explain_titanic_rf), simplify = FALSE) do.call(plot, fi_rf10) + ggtitle(&quot;Permutation based feature importance&quot;, &quot;For Random Forest model and Titanic data&quot;) Figure 15.2: Feature importance for 10 replication of feature importance assessment It is much easier to assess feature importance if they come with some assessment of the uncertainty. We can read from the plot that Age and passenger class are close to each other. Note that intervals are useful for model comparisons. In the Figure @ref{titanic5} we can read feature importance for random forest, gradient boosting and logistic regression models. Best results are achieved by the random forest model and also this method consume more features than others. A good example is the Fare variable, not used in gradient boosting not logistic regression (as a feature highly correlated with passenger class) but consumed in the random forest model. fi_rf &lt;- feature_importance(explain_titanic_rf) fi_gbm &lt;- feature_importance(explain_titanic_gbm) fi_glm &lt;- feature_importance(explain_titanic_lmr) plot(fi_rf, fi_gbm, fi_glm) Figure 15.3: Feature importance for random forest, gradient boosting and logistic regression models 15.3 Example: Price prediction Let’s create a regression model for prediction of apartment prices. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;randomForest&quot;) set.seed(59) model_rf &lt;- randomForest(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + no.rooms + district, data = apartments) A popular loss function for regression model is the root mean square loss \\[ L(x, y) = \\sqrt{\\frac1n \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2} \\] loss_root_mean_square( predict(model_rf, apartments), apartments$m2.price ) ## [1] 193.8477 Let’s calculate feature importance explainer_rf &lt;- explain(model_rf, data = apartmentsTest[,2:6], y = apartmentsTest$m2.price) ## Preparation of a new explainer is initiated ## -&gt; model label : randomForest ([33mdefault[39m) ## -&gt; data : 9000 rows 5 cols ## -&gt; target variable : 9000 values ## -&gt; predict function : yhat.randomForest will be used ([33mdefault[39m) ## -&gt; predicted values : numerical, min = 1977.609 , mean = 3511.789 , max = 5839.917 ## -&gt; residual function : difference between y and yhat ([33mdefault[39m) ## -&gt; residuals : numerical, min = -1970.395 , mean = -0.2658962 , max = 1944.719 ## [32mA new explainer has been created![39m vip &lt;- variable_importance(explainer_rf, loss_function = loss_root_mean_square) vip ## variable dropout_loss label ## 1 _full_model_ 812.9705 randomForest ## 2 no.rooms 846.1691 randomForest ## 3 construction.year 856.1572 randomForest ## 4 floor 874.3738 randomForest ## 5 district 877.9827 randomForest ## 6 surface 888.3874 randomForest ## 7 _baseline_ 1143.5789 randomForest On a diagnostic plot is useful to present feature importance as an interval that start in a loss and ends in a loss of perturbed data. plot(vip) 15.4 More models Much more can be read from feature importance plots if we compare models of a different structure.

Intervals start in a different values, thus we can read that loss for SVM model is the lowest. When we compare other features it looks like in all models the district is the most important feature followed by surface and floor. plot(vip_rf, vip_svm, vip_lm) There is interesting difference between linear model and others in the way how important is the construction.year. For linear model this variable is not importance, while for remaining two models there is some importance.

["featureEffects.html", "Chapter 16 Feature effects 16.1 Global level vs instance level explanations", " Chapter 16 Feature effects In following chapters we introduce tools for extraction of the information between model response and individual model inputs. These tools are useful to summarize how ,,in general’’ model responds to the input of interest. All presented approaches are based on Ceteris Ceteris Paribus Profiles introduced in Chapter @ref{ceterisParibus} but they differ in a way how individual profiles are merged into a global model response. We use the term ,,feature effect’’ to refer to global model response as a function of single or small number of model features. Methods presented in this chapter are useful for extraction information of feature effect, i.e. how a feature is linked with model response. There are many possible applications of such methods, for example: Feature effect may be used for feature engineering. The crude approach to modeling is to fit some elastic model on raw data and then use feature effects to understand the relation between a raw feature and model output and then to transform model input to better fit the model output. Such procedure is called surrogate training. In this procedure an elastic model is trained to learn about link between a feature and the target. Then a new feature is created in a way to better utilized the feature in a simpler model (Gosiewska et al. 2019). In the next chapters we will show how feature effects can be used to transform a continuous variable in to a categorical one in order to improve the model behavior. Feature effect may be used for model validation. Understanding how a model utilizes a feature may be used as a validation of a model against domain knowledge. For example if we expect monotonic relation or linear relation then such expectations can be verified. Also if we expect smooth relation between model and its inputs then the smoothness can be visually examined. In the next chapters we will show how feature effects can be used to warn a model developer that model is unstable and should be regularized. In new domains an understanding of a link between model output and the feature of interest may increase our domain knowledge. It may give quick insights related to the strength or character of the relation between a feature of interest and the model output. The comparison of feature effects between different models may help to understand how different models handle particular features. In the next chapters we will show how feature effects can be used learn limitations of particular classes of models. 16.1 Global level vs instance level explanations The plot below shows Ceteris Paribus Profiles for the random forest rf_5 for 10 selected passengers. Different profiles behave differently. In following chapter we discuss different approaches to aggregation of such profiles into model level feature effects.

PDP were introduced by Friedman in 2000 in his paper devoted to Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) - new type of complex yet effective models (Friedman 2000). For many years PDP as sleeping beauties stay in the shadow of the boosting method. But this has changed in recent years. PDP are very popular and available in most of data science languages. In this chapter we will introduce key intuitions, explain the math beyond PDP and discuss strengths and weaknesses. General idea is to show how the expected model response behaves as a function of a selected feature. Here the term ,,expected’’ will be estimated simply as the average over the population of individual Ceteris Paribus Profiles introduced in 6. 17.1 Definition Partial Dependency Profile for for a model \\(f\\) and a variable \\(x^j\\) is defined as \\[ g_{PD}^{f, j}(z) = E[f(x^j=z, X^{-j})] = E[f(x|^j=z)]. \\] So it’s an expected value for \\(x^j = z\\) over marginal distribution \\(X^{-j}\\) or equivalently expected value of \\(f\\) after variable \\(x^j\\) is set to \\(z\\). Exercise Let \\(f = x_1 + x_2\\) and distribuion of \\((x_1, x_2)\\) is given by \\(x_1 \\sim U[0,1]\\) and \\(x_2=x_1\\). Calculate \\(g_{PD}^{f, 1}(z)\\). Answer \\(g_{PD}^{f, 1}(z) = z + 0.5\\). 17.2 Estimation Let’s see how they are constructed step by step. Here we will use a random forest rf_5 model for the titanic dataset. Examples are related to a single variable age. The expectation cannot be calculated directly as we do not know fully neither the distribution of \\(X^{-j}\\) nor the \\(f()\\). Yet this value may be estimated by as average from CP profiles. \\[ \\hat g_{PD}^{f, j}(z) = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i^j=z, x^{-j}_i)] = \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i|^j=z). \\] Calculate Ceteris Paribus Profiles for observations from the dataset As it was introduced in @ref{ceterisParibus} Ceteris Paribus profiles are calculated for observations. They show how model response change is a selected variable in this observation is modified. \\[ CP^{f, j, x}(z) := f(x|^j = z). \\] Such profiles can be calculated for example with the ceteris_paribus{ingredients} function. (#fig:pdp_part_1)Ceteris Paribus profiles for 100 observations, the age variable and the random forest model So for a single model and a single variable we get a bunch of what-if profiles. In the figure @ref{pdp_part_1} we show an example for 100 observations. Despite some variation (random forest are not as stable as we would hope) we see that most profiles are decreasing. So the older the passengers is the lower is the survival probability. Aggregate Ceteris Paribus into a single Partial Dependency Profile Simple pointwise average across CP profiles. If number of CPprofiles is large, it is enoug to sample some number of them to get resonably accurate PD profiles. Here we show profiles calculated with ingredients package, but find siilar implementation in the pdp package (Greenwell 2017b), ALEPlots package (Apley 2018b) or iml (Molnar, Bischl, and Casalicchio 2018b) package. Such average can be calculated with the aggregate_profiles{ingredients} function. pdp_rf &lt;- aggregate_profiles(cp_rf) plot(pdp_rf) + ggtitle(&quot;Partial Dependency profile&quot;, &quot;For a random forest model / Titanic data&quot;) So for a single model and a single variable we get a profile. See an example in figure @ref{pdp_part_2}. It is much easier than following 100 separate curves, and in cases in which Ceteris Paribus are more or less parallel, the Partial Dependency is a good summary of them. The average response is of course more stable (as it’s an average) and in this case is more or less a decreasing curve. It’s much easier to notice that the older the passenger is the lower the survival probability. Moreover it is easier to notice that the largest drop in survival changes happen for teenagers. On average the survival for adults is 30 percent points smaller than for kids. (#fig:pdp_part_2)Partial Dependency profile as an average for 100 observations 17.3 Clustered Partial Dependency Profiles As we said in the previous section, Partial Dependency is a good summary if Ceteris Paribus profiles are similar, i.e. parallel. But it may happen that the variable of interest is in interaction with some other variable. Then profiles are not parallel because the effect of variable of interest depends on some other variables. So on one hand it would be good to summaries all this Ceteris Paribus profiles with smaller number of profiles. But on another hand a single aggregate may not be enough. To deal with this problem we propose to cluster Ceteris Paribus profiles and check how homogenous are these profiles. The most straightforward approach would be to use a method for clustering, like k-means algorithm or hierarchical clustering, and see how these cluster of profiles behave. Once clusters are established we can aggregate within clusters in the same way as in case of Partial Dependency Plots. Such clusters can be calculated with the cluster_profiles{ingredients} function. We choose the hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage as it gives most stable results. So for a single model and a single variable we get \\(k\\) profiles. The common problem in clustering is the selection of \\(k\\). However in our case, as it’s an exploration, the problem is simpler, as we are interesting if \\(k=1\\) (Partial Dependency is a good summary) or not (there are some interactions). See an example in Figure @ref{pdp_part_4}. It is easier to notice that Ceteris Paribus profiles can be groups in three clusters. Group of passengers with a very large drop in the survival (cluster 1), moderate drop (cluster 2) and almost no drop in survival (cluster 3). Here we do not know what other factors are linked with these clusters, but some additional exploratory analysis can be done to identify these factors. (#fig:pdp_part_4)Cluster profiles for 3 clusters over 100 Ceteris Paribus profiles 17.4 Grouped Partial Dependency Profiles Once we see that variable of interest may be in interaction with some other variable, it is tempting to look for the factor that distinguish clusters. The most straightforward approach is to use some other variable as a grouping variable. This can be done by setting the groups argument in the aggregate_profiles{ingredients} function. library(&quot;ingredients&quot;) selected_passangers &lt;- select_sample(titanic, n = 100) cp_rf &lt;- ceteris_paribus(explain_titanic_rf, selected_passangers) pdp_Sex_rf &lt;- aggregate_profiles(cp_rf, variables = &quot;age&quot;, groups = &quot;gender&quot;) See an example in Figure @ref{pdp_part_5}. Clearly there is an interaction between Age and Sex. The survival for woman is more stable, while for man there is more sudden drop in Survival for older passengers. Check how the interaction for Pclass (passenger class) looks like. (#fig:pdp_part_5)Grouped profiles with respect to the gender variable 17.5 Contrastive Model Comparisons Contrastive comparisons of Partial Dependency Plots are useful not only for subgroups of observations but also for model comparisons. Why one would like to compare models? There are at least three reasons for it. Agreement of models will calm us. Some models are known to be more stable other to be more elastic. If profiles for models from these two classes are not far from each other we can be more convinced that elastic model is not over-fitted. Disagreement of models helps to improve. If simpler interpretable model disagree with an elastic model, this may suggest a feature transformation that can be used to improve the interpretable model. For example if random forest learned non linear relation then it can be captures by a linear model after suitable transformation. Validation of boundary conditions. Some models are know to have different behavior on the boundary, for largest or lowest values. Random forest is known to shrink predictions towards the average, while support vector machines are known to have larger variance at edges. Contrastive comparisons may help to understand differences in boundary behavior. Generic plot{ingredients} function handles multiple models as consecutive arguments. See an example in Figure @ref{pdp_part_7}. Random forest is compared with gradient boosting model and generalized linear model (logistic regression). All three models agree when it comes to a general relation between Age and Survival. Logistic regression is of course the most smooth. Gradient boosting has on average higher predictions than random forest. (#fig:pdp_part_7)Comparison on three predictive models with different structures. References "],
["conditionalProfiles.html", "Chapter 18 Conditional Dependency Profiles 18.1 Definition 18.2 Estimation 18.3 Example", " Chapter 18 Conditional Dependency Profiles One of the largest advantages of the Partial Dependency Profiles is that they are easy to explain, as they are just an average across Ceteris Paribus profiles. But one of the largest disadvantages lies in expectation over marginal distribution which implies that \\(x^j\\) is independent from \\(x^{-j}\\). In many applications this assumption is violated. For example, for the apartments dataset one can expect that features like \\(surface\\) and \\(number.or.rooms\\) are strongly correlated as apartments with larger number of rooms usually have larger surface. It may makes no sense to consider an apartment with 10 rooms and 20 square meters, so it may be misleading to change \\(x^{surface}\\) independently from \\(x^{number.of.rooms}\\). In the titanic dataset we shall expect correlation between fare and passanger class as tickets in the 1st class are the most expensive. There are several attempts to fix this problem. Here we introduce Local Dependency Profiles presented in the (Apley 2018b) under the name M-profiles. The general idea is to use conditional distribution instead of marginal distribution to accomodate for the dependency between \\(x^j\\) and \\(x^{-j}\\). 18.1 Definition Conditional Dependency Profile for a model \\(f\\) and a variable \\(x^j\\) is defined as \\[ g_{CD}^{f, j}(z) = E[f(X^j, X^{-j})|X^j = z]. \\] So it’s an expected value over conditional distribution \\((X^j,X^{-j})|X^j=z\\). Exercise Let \\(f = x_1 + x_2\\) and distribuion of \\((x_1, x_2)\\) is given by \\(x_1 \\sim U[0,1]\\) and \\(x_2=x_1\\). Calculate \\(g_{CD}^{f, 1}(z)\\). Answer \\(g_{CD}^{f, 1}(z) = 2*z\\). 18.2 Estimation Partial Dependency Profiles are defined as an expected value from Ceteris Paribus Profiles. \\[ g^{PD}_i(z) = E_{X_{-i}}[ f(x|^i = z, x^{-i}) ]. \\] And can be estimated as average from CP profiles. \\[ \\hat g^{PD}_i(z) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(x|^i = z, x_j^{-i}). \\] As it was said, if \\(X_i\\) and \\(X_{-i}\\) are related it may have no sense to average CP profiles over marginal \\(X_{-i}\\). Instead, an intuitive approach would to use a conditional distribution \\(X_{-i}|X_i=x_i\\). \\[ g^{M}_i(z) = E_{X_{-i}|X_i=x_i}[ f(x|^i = z, x^{-i}) ]. \\] 18.3 Example See Figure ?? for illustration of difference between marginal and conditional distribution. Such profiles are called Conditional Dependency Profiles and are estimated as \\[ \\hat g^{M}_i(z) = \\frac{1}{|N_i|} \\sum_{j\\in N_i} f(x|^i = z, x_j^{-i}). \\] where \\(N_i\\) is the set of observations with \\(x_i\\) close to \\(z\\). Figure 18.1: (fig:accumulatedCor) As it is justified in (Apley 2018b), there is a serious problem with this approach, illustrated by a following observation. If \\(y\\) depends on \\(x_2\\) but not \\(x_1\\) then the correlation between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) will produce a false relation in the Marginal profiles for feature \\(x_1\\). This problem is also illustrated in the Figure ??. (#fig:mp_part_1)Conditional Dependency Profile for 100 observations References "],
["accumulatedLocalProfiles.html", "Chapter 19 Accumulated Local Profiles 19.1 Definition", " Chapter 19 Accumulated Local Profiles As we showed in the previous chapter, Conditional Dependency Profiles takes into account dependency between features, but it is both advantage and disadvantage. The advantage is that in some cases the dependency is real and should be taken into account when computing expected value of \\(f\\). The disadvantage is that in the Conditional Dependency Profiles we see both effects of the feature of interest \\(x^j\\) and other features that are dependent on it. Accumulated Local Profiles disentangle effects of a feature of interest and features correlated with it. For example, for the apartments dataset one can expect that features like \\(surface\\) and \\(number.or.rooms\\) are correlated but we can also imagine that each of these variables affect the apartment price somehow. Partial Dependency Profiles show how the average price changes as a function of surface, keeping all other variables unchanged. Conditional Dependency Profiles show how the average price changes as a function of surface adjusting all other variables to the current value of the surface. Accumulated Local Profiles show how the average price changes as a function of surface adjusting all other variables to the current value of the surface but extracting changes caused by these other features. Accumulated Local Dependency Profiles presented in the (Apley 2018b) paper. The general idea is to accumulate local changes in model response affected by single feature \\(x^j\\). 19.1 Definition Accumulated Local Profile for a model \\(f\\) and a variable \\(x^j\\) is defined as \\[ g_{AL}^{f, j}(z) = \\int_{z_0}^z E\\left[\\frac{\\partial f(X^j, X^{-j})}{\\partial x_j}|X^j = v\\right] dv + c, \\] where \\(z_0\\) if the lower boundry of \\(x^j\\). The profile \\(g_{AL}^{f, j}(z)\\) is calculated up to some constant \\(c\\). Usually the constant \\(c\\) is selected to keep average \\(g_{AL}^{f, j}\\) equal to 0 or average \\(f\\). The equation may be a bit complex, but the intuition is not that complicated. Instead of aggregation of Ceteris Paribus we just look locally how quickly CP profiles are changing. And AL profile is reconstructed from such local partial changes. So it’s an cummulated expected change of the model response along where the expected values are calculated over conditional distribution \\((X^j,X^{-j})|X^j=v\\). Exercise Let \\(f = x_1 + x_2\\) and distribuion of \\((x_1, x_2)\\) is given by \\(x_1 \\sim U[0,1]\\) and \\(x_2=x_1\\). Calculate \\(g_{AD}^{f, 1}(z)\\). Answer \\(g_{AD}^{f, 1}(z) = z\\).

The most popular techniques for validation (k-fold cross-validation, repeated cross-validation, and so on) test models on data with the same distribution as training data. Yet, in many practical applications, deployed models are working in a changing environment. After some time, due to changes in the environment, model performance may degenerate, as model may be less reliable. Concept drift refers to the change in the data distribution or in the relationships between variables over time. Think about model for energy consumption for a school, over time the school may be equipped with larger number of devices of with more power-efficient devices that may affect the model performance. In this chapter we define basic ideas behind concept drift and propose some solutions. 23.1 Introduction In general, concept drift means that some statistical properties of variables used in the model change over time. This may result in degenerated performance. Thus the early detection of concept drift is very important, as it is needed to adapt quickly to these changes. The term concept usually refers to target variable, but generally, it can also refer to model input of relations between variables. The most general formulation of a concept drift refers to changes in joint distribution of \\(p(X, y)\\). It is useful to define also following measures. Conditional Covariate Drift as change in \\(p(X | y)\\) Conditional Class Drift as change in \\(p(y | X)\\) Covariate Drift or Concept Shift as changes in \\(p(X)\\) Once the drift is detected one may re-fit the model on newer data or update the model. 23.2 Covariate Drift Covariate Drift is a change in distribution of input, change in the distribution of \\(p(X)\\). The input is a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector with variables of possible mixed types and distributions. Here we propose a simple one-dimensional method, that can be applied to each variable separately despite of its type. We do not rely on any formal statistical test, as the power of the test depends on sample size and for large samples the test will detect even small differences. We also consider an use-case for two samples. One sample gathers historical ,,old’’ data, this may be data available during the model development (part of it may be used as training and part as test data). Second sample is the current ,,new’’ data, and we want to know is the distribution of \\(X_{old}\\) differs from the distribution of \\(X_{new}\\). There is a lot of distances between probability measures that can be used here (as for example Wasserstein, Total Variation and so on). We are using the Non-Intersection Distance due to its easy interpretation. For categorical variables \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) non-intersection distance is defined as \\[ d(P,Q) = 1 - \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal X} \\min(p_i, q_i) \\] where \\(\\mathcal X\\) is a set of all possible values while \\(p_i\\) and \\(q_i\\) are probabilities for these values in distribution \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) respectively. An intuition behind this distance is that it’s amount of the distribution \\(P\\) that is not shared with \\(Q\\) (it’s symmetric). The smaller the value the closes are these distributions. For continuous variables we discretize their distribution in the spirit of \\(\\chi^2\\) test. 23.3 Code snippets Here we are going to use the drifter package that implements some tools for concept drift detection. As an illustration we use two datasets from the DALEX package, namely apartments (here we do not have drift) and dragons (here we do have drift). library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;drifter&quot;) # here we do not have any drift head(apartments, 2) ## m2.price construction.year surface floor no.rooms district ## 1 5897 1953 25 3 1 Srodmiescie ## 2 1818 1992 143 9 5 Bielany d &lt;- calculate_covariate_drift(apartments, apartments_test) d ## Variable Shift ## ------------------------------------- ## m2.price 4.9 ## construction.year 6.0 ## surface 6.8 ## floor 4.9 ## no.rooms 2.8 ## district 2.6 # here we do have drift head(dragons, 2) ## year_of_birth height weight scars colour year_of_discovery ## 1 -1291 59.40365 15.32391 7 red 1700 ## 2 1589 46.21374 11.80819 5 red 1700 ## number_of_lost_teeth life_length ## 1 25 1368.433 ## 2 28 1377.047 d &lt;- calculate_covariate_drift(dragons, dragons_test) d ## Variable Shift ## ------------------------------------- ## year_of_birth 8.9 ## height 15.3 . ## weight 14.7 . ## scars 4.6 ## colour 17.9 . ## year_of_discovery 97.5 *** ## number_of_lost_teeth 6.3 ## life_length 8.6 23.4 Residual Drift Perhaps the most obvious negative effect of the concept drift is that the model performance degrades over time. But this is also something that is straightforward to verify. One can calculate distribution of residuals on new data and compare this distribution with residuals obtained on old data. Again, we have two samples, residuals calculated on the old dataset \\[ r_{old} = y_{old} - \\hat y_{old} = y_{old} - f_{old}(X_{old}) \\] versus residuals calculated on the new dataset \\[ r_{new} = y_{new} - \\hat y_{new} = y_{new} - f_{old}(X_{new}) \\] We can use any distance between distributions to compare \\(r_{new}\\) and \\(r_{old}\\), for example the non-intersection distance. 23.5 Code snippets Here we are going to use the drifter package. library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) library(&quot;drifter&quot;) library(&quot;ranger&quot;) data_old &lt;- apartments_test[1:4000,] data_new &lt;- apartments_test[4001:8000,] predict_function &lt;- function(m,x,...) predict(m, x, ...)$predictions model_old &lt;- ranger(m2.price ~ ., data = apartments) calculate_residuals_drift(model_old, data_old, data_new, data_old$m2.price, data_new$m2.price, predict_function = predict_function) ## Variable Shift ## ------------------------------------- ## Residuals 4.1 23.6 Model Drift Model Drift is a change in the relation between target variable and input variables, change in \\(p(y|X)\\). The input is a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector with variables of possible mixed types and distributions. Here we propose a simple one-dimensional method based on Partial Dependency Plots introduced in the Chapter ??. PDP profiles summaries marginal relation between \\(\\hat y\\) and variable \\(x_i\\). The idea behind concept drift is to compare two models, the old model \\(f_{old}\\) and model refitted on the new data \\(f_{new}\\) and compare these models through PDP profiles. For each variable we can obtain scores for drift calculated as \\(L_2\\) distance between PDP profiles for both models. \\[ drift_{i} = \\frac 1 {|Z_i|}\\int_{z\\in Z_i} (PDP_i(f_{old}) - PDP_i(f_{new}))^2 dz \\] where \\(Z_i\\) is the set of values for variable \\(x_i\\) (for simplicity we assume that it’s an interval) while \\(PDP_i(f_{new})\\) is the PDP profile for variable \\(i\\) calculated for the model \\(f_{new}\\). 23.7 Code snippets Here we are going to use the drifter package. Instead of using old and new data here we compare model trained on data with males versus new dataset that contain data for females.

The extensions are useful to identify or visualize pairwise interactions between explanatory variables. 24.2 Intuition Figure 24.1 presents response (prediction) surface for the titanic_lmr_v6 model for two explanatory variables, age and sibsp, from the titanic dataset (see Section 4.1). We are interested in the change of the model prediction induced jointly by the variables. [TOMASZ: THIS IS A BIT WEAK. WHAT INTUITIVE IS ABOUT THE PLOT? WHAT CAN BE SEEN DIFFERENTLY THAN IN AN 1D CP PROFILE? WHICH STRUCTURE WOULD WE LOOK FOR?] Figure 24.1: (fig:profile2d) Ceteris-paribus profile for age and sibsp explanatory variables for the titanic_lmr_v6 model. 24.3 Method The definition of one-dimensional CP profiles (see Section 6.3) may be easily extended to two or more explanatory variables. A two-dimensional CP profile for model \\(f()\\), explanatory variables \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), and point \\(x^*\\) is defined as follows: \\[ CP^{f, (j,k), x^*}(z_1, z_2) \\equiv f(x^*|^{(j,k)} = (z_1,z_2)). \\] Thus, a two-dimensional (2D) CP profile is a function that provides the dependence of the instance prediction of the model on the values of \\(j\\)-th and \\(k\\)-th explanatory variables \\(Z_1\\) and \\(Z_2\\), respectively. The values of \\(Z_1\\) and \\(Z_2\\) are taken to go through the range of values typical for the variables. All other explanatory variables are kept fixed at the values given by \\(x^*\\). The corresponding variable importance measure is defined as follows: \\[ vip^{CP}_{j,k}(x^*) = \\int_{\\mathcal R}\\int_{\\mathcal R} |CP^{f,(j,k),x^*}(z_1,z_2) - f(x^*)| g^{j,k}(z_1,z_2)dz_1dz_2=E_{X_j,X_k}[|CP^{f,j,x^*}(X_j,X_k) - f(x^*)|], \\] where the expected value is taken over the joint distribution of the \\(j\\)-th and \\(k\\)-th explanatory variable. Such multi-dimensional extensions are useful to check if, for instance, the model involves interactions. In particular, presence of pairwise interactions may be detected with 2D CP profiles. 24.4 Example: Titanic data A natural way to visualize 2D CP profiles is to use a heat map for all pairs of explanatory variables as, in Figure 24.2. Figure 24.2: (fig:profile2dAll) Two-dimensional ceteris-paribus profiles for all pairs of explanatory variables for the titanic_lmer_v6 model. Black-cross marks the point of interest. If the number of pairs of explanatory variables is small or moderate, then it is possible to present 2D CP profiles for all pairs of variables. If the number of pairs is large, we can use the variable importance measure to order the pairs based on their importance and select the most important pairs for purposes of illustration. [TOMASZ: WE SHOULD INCLUDE HERE A MORE SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION REFERRING TO “HENRY”.] 24.5 Pros and cons Two-dimensional CP profiles can be used to identify the presence and the influence of pairwise interactions in a model. However, for models with a large number of explanatory variables, the number of pairs will be large. Consequently, inspection of all possible 2D CP profiles may be challenging. Moreover, the profiles are more difficult to read and interpret than the 1D CP profiles.

More details and examples can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/ingredients/. There are also other R packages that offer similar functionality, like condvis (O’Connell, Hurley, and Domijan 2017) or ICEbox (Goldstein et al. 2015b). We use the random forest model titanic_rf_v6 developed for the Titanic dataset (see Section @ref(model_titanic_rf)) as the example.

["variableAttributionMethods.html", "Chapter 25 Variable attribution for linear models 25.1 Introduction 25.2 Intuition 25.3 Method 25.4 Example: Wine quality 25.5 Pros and Cons 25.6 Code snippets", " Chapter 25 Variable attribution for linear models 25.1 Introduction In this chapter we introduce the concept and the intuitions underlying ‘’variable attribution,’’ i.e., the decomposition of the difference between the single-instance and the average model predictions among the different explanatory variables. We can think about the following examples: Assume that we are interested in predicting the risk of heart attack based on person’s age, sex, and smoking habits. A patient may want to know which factors have the highest impact on the his/her risk score. Consider a model for prediction of apartment prices. An investor may want to know how much of the predicted price may be attributed to, for instance, the location of an apartment. Consider a model for credit scoring. A customer may want to know if factors like gender, age, or number of children influence model predictions. In each of those cases we want to attribute a part of the model prediction to a single explanatory variable. This can be done directly for linear models. Hence, in this chapter We focus on those models. The method can be easily extended to generalized linear models. Model-agnostic approaches will be presented in Chapters 9 and 11. 25.2 Intuition Assume a classical linear model for response \\(Y\\) with \\(p\\) explanatory variables collected in the vector \\(X = (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p)\\) and coefficients \\(\\beta = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, .., \\beta_p)\\), where \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept. The prediction for \\(Y\\) at point \\(X=x=(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_p)\\) is given by the expected value of \\(Y\\) conditional on \\(X=x\\). For a linear model, the expected value is given by the following linear combination: \\[ E_Y(Y | x) = f(x) = \\beta_0 + x_1 \\beta_1 + \\ldots + x_p \\beta_p. \\] We are interested in the contribution of the \\(i\\)-th explanatory variable to model prediction \\(f(x^*)\\) for a single observation described by \\(x^*\\). In this case, the contribution is equal to \\(x^*_i\\beta_i\\), because the \\(i\\)-th variable occurs only in this term. As it will become clear in the sequel, it is easier to interpret the variable’s contribution if \\(x_i\\) is is centered by subtracting a constant \\(\\hat x_i\\) (usually, the mean of \\(x_i\\)). This leads the following, intuitive formula for the variable attribution: \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = \\beta_i (x_i^* - \\hat x_i). \\] 25.3 Method We want to calculate \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\), which is the contribution of the \\(i\\)-th explanatory variable to the prediction of model \\(f()\\) at point \\(x^*\\). Assume that \\(E_Y(Y | x^*) \\approx f(x^*)\\), where \\(f(x^*)\\) is the value of the model at \\(x^*\\). A possible approach to define \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) is to measure how much the expected model response changes after conditioning on \\(x_i^*\\): \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = E_Y(Y | x^*) - E_{X_i}\\{E_Y[Y | (x_1^*,\\ldots,x_{i-1}^*,X_i,x_{i+1}^*,x_p^*)]\\}\\approx f(x^*) - E_{X_i}[f(x_{-i}^*)], \\] where \\(x_{-i}^*\\) indicates that variable \\(X_i\\) in vector \\(x_{-i}^*\\) is treated as random. For the classical linear model, if the explanatory variables are independent, \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) can be expressed as follows: \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = f(x^*) - E_{X_i}[f(x_{-i}^*)] = \\beta_0 + x_1^* \\beta_1 + \\ldots + x_p^* \\beta_p - E_{X_i}[\\beta_0 + x_1^* \\beta_1 + \\ldots +\\beta_i X_i \\ldots + x_p^* \\beta_p] = \\beta_i[x^*_i - E_{X_i}(X_i)]. \\] In practice, given a dataset, the expected value of \\(X_i\\) can be estimated by the sample mean \\(\\bar x_i\\). This leads to \\[ v(f, x^*, i) = \\beta_i (x^*_i - \\bar x_i). \\] Note that the linear-model-based prediction may be re-expressed in the following way: \\[ f(x^*) = [\\beta_0 + \\bar x_1 \\beta_1 + ... + \\bar x_p \\beta_p] + [(x_1^* - \\bar x_1) \\beta_1 + ... + (x_p^* - \\bar x_p) \\beta_p] \\] \\[ \\equiv [average \\ prediction] + \\sum_{j=1}^p v(f, x^*, j). \\] Thus, the contributions of the explanatory variables are the differences between the model prediction for \\(x^*\\) and the average prediction. ** NOTE for careful readers ** Obviously, sample mean \\(\\bar x_i\\) is an estimator of the expected value \\(E_{X_i}(X_i)\\), calculated using a dataset. For the sake of simplicity we do not emphasize these differences in the notation. Also, we ignore the fact that, in practice, we never know the model coefficients and we work with an estimated model. Also, we assumed that the explanatory variables are independent, which may not be the case. We will return to this problem in Section 10, when we will discuss interactions. 25.4 Example: Wine quality Figure 25.1 shows the relation between alcohol and wine quality, based on the wine dataset (Cortez et al. 2009). The linear model is \\[ quality(alcohol) = 2.5820 + 0.3135 * alcohol. \\] The weakest wine in the dataset has 8% of alcohol, while the average alcohol concentration is 10.51%. Thus, the contribution of alcohol to the model prediction for the weakest wine is \\(0.3135 \\cdot (8-10.51) = -0.786885\\). This means that low concentration of alcohol for this wine (8%) decreses the predicted quality by \\(-0.786885\\). Note, that it would be misleading to use \\(x_i^*\\beta_i = 0.3135*8 = 2.508\\) as the alcohol contribution to the quality. The positive value of the product would not correrspond to the intuition that, in the presence of a positive relation, a smaller alcohol concentration should imply a lower quality of the wine. Figure 25.1: (fig:attribution1a)Relation between wine quality and concentration of alcohol assessed with linear model 25.5 Pros and Cons The introduced values \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) do not depend on neither scale nor location of \\(X_i\\); hence, it is easier to understand than, for instance, the standardized value of \\(\\beta_i\\). For the classical linear model, \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) is not an approximation and it is directly linked with the structure of a model. An obvious diasadvantage is that the definition of \\(v(f, x^*, i)\\) is very much linear-model based. Also, it does not, in any way, reduce the model complexity; if model has 10 parameters then the prediction is decomposed into 10 numbers. Maybe these numbers are easier to understand, but dimensionality of model description has not changed. 25.6 Code snippets In this section, we present an example of computing variable attributions using the HR dataset (see Section ?? for more details). To calculate variable attributions for a particular point, first we have got to define this point: dilbert &lt;- data.frame(gender = factor(&quot;male&quot;, levels = c(&quot;male&quot;, &quot;female&quot;)), age = 57.7, hours = 42.3, evaluation = 2, salary = 2) Variable attributions for linear and generalized linear models may be directly extracted by applying the predict() function, with the argument type = \"terms\", to an object containing results of fitting of a model. To illustrate the approach for logistic regression, we build a logistic regression model for the binary variable status == \"fired\" and extract the estimated model coefficients: library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) model_fired &lt;- glm(status == &quot;fired&quot; ~ ., data = DALEX::HR, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) coef(model_fired) ## (Intercept) gendermale age hours evaluation ## 5.737945729 -0.066803609 -0.001503314 -0.102021120 -0.425793369 ## salary ## -0.015740080 For the new observation, the predicted value of the logit of the probability of being fired is obtained by applying the predict() function: as.vector(pred.inst &lt;- predict(model_fired, dilbert)) # new pediction ## [1] 0.3858406 On the other hand, variable attributions can be obtained by applying the predict() function with the type=\"terms\" argument: (var.attr &lt;- predict(model_fired, dilbert, type = &quot;terms&quot;)) # attributions ## gender age hours evaluation salary ## 1 -0.03361889 -0.02660691 0.7555555 0.5547197 0.007287334 ## attr(,&quot;constant&quot;) ## [1] -0.8714962 The largest contributions to the prediction come from variables ‘’hours’’ and ‘’evaluation.’’ Variables ‘’gender’’ and ‘’age’’ slightly decrease the predicted value. The sum of the attributions is equal to sum(var.attr) ## [1] 1.257337 The attribute constant of object var.attr provides the ‘’average’’ prediction, i.e., the predicted logit for an obsrvation defined by the means of the explanatory variables, as can be seen from the calculation below: coef(model_fired)%*%c(1, mean((HR$gender==&quot;male&quot;)), mean(HR$age), mean(HR$hours), mean(HR$evaluation), mean(HR$salary)) ## [,1] ## [1,] -0.8714962 Adding the ‘’average’’ prediction to the sum of the variable attributions results in the new-observation prediction: attributes(var.attr)$constant + sum(var.attr) ## [1] 0.3858406 Below we illustrate how to implement this approach with the DALEX package. Toward this end, functions explain() and single_prediction() can be used. Object model_fired stores the definition of the logistic-regression model used earlier in this section. The contents of object attribution correspond to the results obtained by using function predict(). library(&quot;DALEX&quot;) explainer_fired &lt;- explain(model_fired, data = HR, y = HR$status == &quot;fired&quot;, label = &quot;fired&quot;) ## Preparation of a new explainer is initiated ## -&gt; model label : fired ## -&gt; data : 7847 rows 8 cols ## -&gt; target variable : 7847 values ## -&gt; predict function : yhat.glm will be used ([33mdefault[39m) ## -&gt; predicted values : numerical, min = 0.00861694 , mean = 0.3638333 , max = 0.7822214 ## -&gt; residual function : difference between y and yhat ([33mdefault[39m) ## -&gt; residuals : numerical, min = -0.7755901 , mean = -1.294707e-13 , max = 0.9820537 ## [32mA new explainer has been created![39m (attribution &lt;- single_prediction(explainer_fired, dilbert)) ## variable contribution variable_name variable_value ## 1 (Intercept) 0.363833312 Intercept 1 ## hours + hours = 42.3 0.109221944 hours 42.3 ## evaluation + evaluation = 2 0.134863451 evaluation 2 ## salary + salary = 2 0.001751398 salary 2 ## age + age = 57.7 -0.006343784 age 57.7 ## gender + gender = male -0.008045314 gender male ## 11 final_prognosis 0.595281007 ## cummulative sign position label ## 1 0.3638333 1 1 fired ## hours 0.4730553 1 2 fired ## evaluation 0.6079187 1 3 fired ## salary 0.6096701 1 4 fired ## age 0.6033263 -1 5 fired ## gender 0.5952810 -1 6 fired ## 11 0.5952810 X 7 fired After object attribution has been created, a plot presenting the variable attributions can be easily constructed: plot(attribution) References "],
